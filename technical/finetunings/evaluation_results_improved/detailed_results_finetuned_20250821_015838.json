    "reference_summary": "Until 1960 Cyprus was a colony of the UK.\nIn 1960, pursuant to the Cyprus Act, the Treaty concerning the Establishment of the Republic of Cyprus between the UK, Turkey Greece and Cyprus and an exchange of notes between the UK and Cyprus, Cyprus became an independent Republic.\nThe territory of the new republic was composed of the island of Cyprus with the exception of two areas Akrotiri and Dhekelia which were retained under UK sovereignty as Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) for the purposes of accommodating military bases.\nArticle 40(1) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) (the Convention) as modified by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (1967) (the Protocol) states that: any State may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare that this Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for the international relations of which it is responsible.\nOn 24 October 1956, prior to Cypriot independence, the UK notified the UN Secretary General that, subject to certain reservations, the Convention would be extended to Cyprus.\nPost independence, Cyprus notified the Secretary General in 1963 that it had acceded to the Convention and in 1968 to the Protocol.\nNo notification has ever been made by the UK specifically in relation to the SBAs post Cypriot independence.\nThe Respondents are six refugees.\nIn October 1998 they boarded a ship in Lebanon which was bound for Italy but which foundered off the coast of Cyprus.\nOn 8 October 75 passengers including the respondents were airlifted to safety by RAF helicopters and brought to Akrotiri in south western Cyprus.\nIn due course they were accepted as lawful refugees under the Convention by the SBA Administration, and permitted to remain.\nThe SBA Administration sought to persuade the UK government to allow them to resettle in the UK but this was not acceptable to Ministers.\nEver since then they have lived in disused and highly unsatisfactory service accommodation in the SBA, while continuing to press for their admission to the UK, on the basis that this is the only practicable way for the UK to discharge its obligations to them under the Refugee Convention.\nThe arrival of the Respondents in the SBAs followed by further arrivals in 2000 and 2001 gave rise to arguments between the SBAs and Cyprus about which of them was to be responsible for the refugees and asylum seekers among them.\nThese arguments were resolved for future arrivals on 20 February 2003 when the UK and Cyprus entered into a Memorandum of Understanding relating to illegal migrants and asylum seekers (the 2003 Memorandum).\nThe agreement provided, in summary, for the full range of governmental services to be provided to refugees by Cyprus but at the expense of the UK.\nShortly after the 2003 Memorandum, the SBA Administrator enacted the Refugee Ordinance 2003 which gave effect within the SBAs to rights substantially corresponding to those conferred by the Convention.\nThe 2003 Memorandum did not apply to refugees such as the Respondents who had arrived in the SBAs prior to the date of its conclusion.\nThe Appellants case is that in 2005 the Cypriot authorities agreed with the SBA Administration that they would deal with refugees recognised as such by the SBA Administration in accordance with the 2003 Memorandum irrespective of the date of their arrival in the SBAs.\nThis agreement, however, has never been reduced to writing.\nThe Respondents were unwilling for responsibility for them under the Convention to be transferred to the Republic, and did not accept that this could lawfully be done without their consent.\nThey continued to press for admission to the UK, latterly with the support of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThe unhappy course of the ensuing dispute is summarised in the judgment.\nIt came to a head when in 2013, the Respondents formally asked to be admitted to the UK.\nIn a decision dated 25 November 2014, the Secretary of State refused entry.\nThe Respondents challenged that decision on the basis that it was inconsistent with the Convention.\nThe High Court held that the Convention did not extend to the SBAs as a matter of international law, but quashed the Secretary of States decision on the basis that she had failed to take into account concerns raised by the UNHCR.\nThe Court of Appeal overturned that decision, declared that the Convention did extend to the SBAs and directed the Secretary of State to make a fresh decision on whether to admit the Respondents to the UK, having regard to the UKs obligations under the Convention.\nOn 6 July 2017, the Secretary of State made a fresh decision refusing to admit the Respondents on the basis that she considered that they could resettle in the Cyprus or, alternatively that the UK could comply with its obligations by arranging for the Respondents to be supported by Cyprus as agreed in 2005.\nThe broad question at issue in the appeal is whether the Respondents are entitled or should be permitted to be resettled in the UK on the basis of the Convention or that in the exceptional circumstances of the case the Secretary of State should exercise his discretion to admit them.\nThe specific issues identified by the Court as essential to the resolution of the appeal are as follows [60]: (i) Does the Convention (as extended by the 1967 Protocol) apply to the SBAs? (ii) Does the Convention by its terms entitle the Respondents to be resettled in the UK? (iii) Was the Memorandum of Understanding of 2003 a valid performance of the Convention obligations for those within its scope? In particular: a. Was the UK in principle entitled to fulfil its obligations under the Convention by arranging for support to be provided by Cyprus? b.\nIf so, were the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (including the 2003 Refugee Ordinance) a proper basis on which to do so? a.\nWas the UK entitled in 2005 to make the same arrangements in respect of the Respondents without their consent given their lawful and accepted presence as refugees in the SBAs since 2000 (it being accepted that the Respondents are entitled to continue to live in the SBAs [107])? b.\nIf so, was the 2005 agreement with Cyprus a legally effective means of doing so, having regard to its informality and the absence of incorporation into SBA law? c.\nHas the support of Cyprus for the Respondents in accordance with the 2005 agreement been available in practice, and can it be assured in the future? (v) If the 2005 agreement, for whatever reason, was not a legally effective means of discharging the UKs obligations to the Respondents under the Convention, or if such support has not been available in practice, what are the consequences, in terms of rights or remedies potentially available in these proceedings, and how should the court give effect to them in its order? (iv) If the answer to (iii) is yes:\nThe Supreme Court gives an interim judgment.\nIt is final as to the issues covered (issues (i) (iii)), but interim in the sense that other issues will have to be decided (issues (iv) (v)) before the appeal can be finally determined.\nCertain critical and difficult issues had not been clearly identified in the agreed statement of facts and issues, nor adequately covered by the written or oral submissions.\nIn fairness to the parties and in order to reach a fully informed conclusion, the court sees no alternative but to invite further submissions on the matters identified in the interim judgment.\nIssue (i) Until 1960 the Convention unquestionably applied to the territory now comprised in the SBAs [63].\nTreaty obligations cease to apply to a territory where it secedes from the state which entered into the treaty, or where a formerly dependent territory becomes independent of the parent state which entered into the treaty [64].\nThe Cyprus Act 1960 did not alter the status of the SBAs but merely excluded them from the transfer of territory to the new Republic of Cyprus when it became independent [69].\nAs a matter of international law the Convention continues to apply to the SBAs by virtue of the declaration in 1956, in the same way it applied to the colony of Cyprus before 1960.\nArticle VII(4) of the Protocol provides that where a state made a declaration under Article 40(1) or (2) of the Convention extending its application to a territory for whose international relations it was responsible, and then acceded to the Protocol, the declaration should apply to the Protocol also, unless that state notified the Secretary General to the contrary.\nNo further declaration was required to extend the Protocol to dependent territories where the original Convention applied.\nThe UK acceded to the Protocol without any reservation relating to the SBAs.\nSince the Convention continued to apply to the SBAs after 1960, the Protocol applies there also [71].\nIssue (ii) The Convention does not entitle the Respondents to be resettled in the UK metropolitan territory.\nA states duties under the Convention to a refugee reaching a particular territory for whose international relations the state is responsible are in principle and in normal circumstances limited to providing and securing the refugees Convention rights in that context [89].\nThe widespread use of colonial clauses in international treaties reflects the principle that for certain purposes, including the application of treaties, dependent territories of a state are treated as having a status in international law distinct from that of the parent states metropolitan territory [76].\nLike many multilateral treaties, the Convention was framed to apply only to a states home country or metropolitan territory unless extended to other territories under Article 40 [78].\nArticle 40 suggests that for the purposes of the Convention the metropolitan territory and its dependent territories are to be treated as separate units [80].\nSimilarly, other articles of the Convention indicate that the metropolitan territory is to be treated as distinct such as Articles 15, 17 to 24, 26, 19, 32 and 34 [81 88].\nIssue (iii) The Respondents submission that the 2003 Memorandum was not a proper basis for the provision of the support for refugees required by the Convention is rejected [103].\nThere are uniquely close practical links between the SBAs and Cyprus [91 93].\nThe Convention does refer to the appropriate treatment of refugees in a States territory and the provision of facilities to refugees there.\nBut nothing in the Convention is expressly directed to a situation like that which exists in Cyprus and nothing in it is expressly inconsistent with the nature of the arrangements which the UK has made with Cyprus [94].\nInternational courts and tribunals will interpret a treaty in line with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThey will endeavour to place the factual situation as it has developed since the inception of the treaty within the context of the preserved and developing treaty relationship in order to achieve its object and purpose in so far as that is feasible [95].\nSubject to issues about the precise interpretation of certain articles, the court does not find objection in principle to some, most or all of the supporting facilities required for refugees being provided by co operative and effective arrangements with the Republic.\nThe more difficult issues are as to its application to those already accepted as lawful refugees [96].\nIssues (iv) and (v) have been left for future determination and further submissions.\nThe parties may be able to reach agreement without further argument on those issues [104 114].\nSo far as they remain in dispute the appeal should be relisted for further submissions as soon as practicable [115].",

    "reference_summary": "The question in this appeal is whether there is a requirement for the prosecution to prove a defendant had an absence of belief that the person they were having sexual intercourse with was over the age of 13, before they can be convicted of an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14.\nThe appellant, who was 17 years old at the time, had sexual intercourse with a 13 year old girl.\nInitially the girl informed her mother of this fact but told her the intercourse had not been consensual.\nThe appellant was arrested.\nSubsequently however, the girl withdrew the allegation and admitted the sex had been consensual.\nAs a result, the appellant was charged with the offence of having unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14 contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland 1885 1923) (the 1885 Act) a serious offence that carries a maximum of life imprisonment.\nThe appellant was represented and pleaded guilty to the charge at Belfast Crown Court in 2004.\nHe was sentenced to 3 years detention in a Young Offenders Centre, suspended for 2 years.\nHe had pleaded guilty on the understanding that it was no defence to a charge under section 4 for the defendant to show he believed the girl was over the age of 13.\nFollowing his conviction the appellant received advice from different solicitors and launched an appeal, arguing that the Crown was indeed required to prove that the appellant did not believe the girl was over 13 years old.\nThe appellant argued before the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal that section 4 was silent as to such a defence but in view of the legislative history and its seriousness, it must be presumed that there is a mental element to the offence.\nThe appellant relied on the general presumption that criminal offences require the prosecution to prove mens rea i.e. some intent on the part of the accused, unless explicitly excluded by the language of the statute or necessarily inferred from the language of the offence.\nSuch a presumption is hard to displace, especially in relation to serious offences.\nThe Court of Appeal rejected the appellants arguments and held that no defence of reasonable or honest belief existed.\nAll that was necessary was for the prosecution to prove the accused had had sex with a girl who was actually under the age of 14.\nThe appellant thus appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\nLord Kerr gives the judgment of the court.\nA clearly discernible historical trend of increasing the age at which liability for more serious offences is incurred, while reducing the sentence imposed, can be detected [3].\nSection 4 as originally enacted referred to unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 13 years old.\nThis was amended to 14 years by the Children and Young Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1950 (the 1950 Act).\nSection 5 of the 1885 Act created the same offence in relation to a girl between the ages of 13 15.\nSection 5 and section 6 (permitting defilement on premises) contained provisos that it would be a defence to show that the accused reasonably believed the girl was of or above the age of 16 years.\nSuch defences were abolished by section 2 of the Criminal Law (Northern Ireland) Amendment Act 1923, as amended by section 140 of the 1950 Act.\nSection 5 thus referred to any girl under 17 years old, with an express prohibition of any defence of reasonable belief that she was 17 or older.\nNo such type of defence has ever been explicitly provided in any version of section 4 [7 13].\nThe constitutional principle that mens rea is presumed to be required in order to establish criminal liability is a strong one.\nIt is not to be displaced in the absence of clear statutory language or unmistakably necessary implication.\nWhere the statutory offence is grave and carries a heavy penalty or a substantial social stigma, the case is enhanced against implying that mens rea of any ingredient of the offence is not needed [26].\nOne must at least begin with an examination of what the legislative intention was before considering whether modification of that intention is justified by later amendments or contemporary social contexts [31].\nThere can really be no doubt that the section in its original form was intended to impose criminal liability for carnal knowledge of a female under the age of 14 without proof that the perpetrator knew or had reason to believe that she was below that age.\nThe decision in R v Prince (1875) LR 2 CCR 154 10 years prior to the 1885 Act confirmed that proof of knowledge or lack of reasonable belief in the age of the victim was not required under section 51 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.\nThis formed the crucial backdrop to the 1885 Act.\nThe juxtaposition of sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 Act, which originally contained a defence of reasonable belief, with section 4 make it clear that no such defence was to be provided for under the latter section [32].\nIt would be anomalous if the subsequent removal of the defence from sections 5 and 6 meant that it should be implied into section 4 to which it had not previously applied [34].\nWhile the amended legislation is to be construed in its revised form, it does not follow that its antecedent history has to be entirely left out of account.\nTo suggest that the removal of the defence under sections 5 and 6 would have the effect of introducing it under section 4 by implication takes contrivance too far [36].\nThe policy approach of protecting younger females by ensuring that a defence of reasonable belief should not be available has been unswerving.\nFurther, there is nothing in the contemporary social context which militates against the denial of the defence of belief as to age for section 4 offences [37 38].",

    "reference_summary": "PJS is married to YMA.\nBoth are well known individuals in the entertainment business.\nThey have two young children.\nBetween 2009 and 2011 PJS had a sexual relationship with AB and, on one occasion, with AB and CD.\nIn January 2016 the editor of the Sun on Sunday newspaper, published by News Group Newspapers (NGN), notified PJS that he proposed to publish ABs account of the relationship.\nPJS issued proceedings claiming that the publication would breach his rights to privacy and confidentiality, protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\nHe applied for an interim injunction, to restrain publication pending the trial of his claim.\nThis application required the court to balance PJSs article 8 rights with NGNs right to freedom of expression under article 10 ECHR, and was subject to s 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA).\nSection 12(3) provides that an interim injunction can only be granted if a claimant is likely to establish at trial that publication should not be allowed.\nSection 12(4) provides that the court must have particular regard to the importance of freedom of expression and, in relation to journalistic material, to the extent to which the material has or is about to become available to the public, to the public interest in the material being published, as well as to any relevant privacy code.\nThe High Court refused the application but the Court of Appeal allowed PJSs appeal on 22 January 2016 and granted an interim injunction which restrained publication of information which would disclose the identity of PJS and details of the sexual relationship.\nOn 6 April 2016 ABs account was published in print in the United States, and thereafter in Canada and in Scotland, identifying PJS.\nAs a result of representations by the appellants solicitors, publication was restricted to hardcopy editions and online publication was geo blocked such that internet users in England and Wales could not readily access those sites.\nHowever, details have been published on a number of other websites and social media, although the appellants solicitors have been doing their best to remove offending URLs and web pages.\nOn 12 April 2016 NGN applied to the Court of Appeal to set aside the interim injunction on the ground that, as the information was now in the public domain, PJS was unlikely to obtain a permanent injunction at trial and the interim injunction could therefore no longer be justified.\nOn 18 April 2016 the Court of Appeal held that the injunction should be discharged.\nThe Supreme Court restored it pending determination of PJSs application for permission to appeal, which it ordered to be heard with the appeal, should permission be granted.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously grants permission to appeal; and allows PJSs appeal by a majority of 4 to 1.\nLord Mance gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Neuberger and Lady Hale (each of whom give supporting judgments) and Lord Reed agree.\nLord Toulson gives a dissenting judgment.\nAs the Court of Appeal erred in law, the Supreme Court grants permission to appeal and must decide for itself whether the interim injunction should be discharged or maintained [19].\nThe principal error is that the Court of Appeal wrongly directed itself that s 12 HRA enhanced the weight to be given to article 10 rights in the balancing exercise, when the case law establishes that neither article 8 nor article 10 has preference over the other and what is necessary is an intense focus on the comparative rights being claimed in the individual case [20][51].\nThe Court of Appeal also referred to a limited public interest in the story when it had rightly held that there was none in its earlier judgment [21].\nThere is not, on its own, any public interest in the legal sense in the disclosure of private sexual encounters even if they involve infidelity or more than one person at the same time, however famous the individual(s) involved [24][32].\nIt is essential to distinguish between the claims for breach of privacy and for breach of confidence.\nThe widespread availability of the information in the public domain may well mean that PJS would face difficulties in obtaining a permanent injunction in so far as his claim is based on confidentiality [57], but different considerations apply to privacy claims, where the impact of any additional disclosure on the likely distress to PJS and his family, and the degree of intrusion or harassment, continues to be highly relevant.\nThe question is whether the injunction can still serve a useful purpose.\nIt is important to consider the medium and form of the previous publication: there is a qualitative difference in intrusiveness and distress between the disclosures on the internet which have occurred and the media storm which would follow from publication by the English media in hard copy, together with unrestricted internet coverage of the story [35][63].\nPublication in this form is contrary to the interests of PJSs children and in breach of the requirement to show an exceptional public interest for the intrusion set out in the Editors Code of Practice to which NGN has subscribed [36].\nLady Hales judgment discusses this consideration further, partly in redacted form to prevent identification [72 78] Rights must be practical and effective.\nThe grant of an injunction is the only remedy of any value to PJS and his family, for whom the invasion of privacy occasioned by further disclosure in the English media, rather than any award of damages, is likely to be the real concern [43].\nThe central issue is whether the trial judge is likely to grant a permanent injunction.\nBalancing all these factors, the majority concludes that PJS is likely to establish at trial that the proposed publication by NGN constitutes a serious breach of his and his familys privacy rights, with no countervailing public interest on the present evidence, and that he is likely to be granted a permanent injunction notwithstanding the internet and social media publication.\nAccordingly, the interim injunction is maintained [44 45][68].\nLord Toulson, dissenting, would have upheld the discharge of the injunction.\nHe considers that where the information is widely available, the form of the publication should not make a significant difference: the purpose of s 12(3) is to discourage the granting of an injunction to prevent publication of information which is already widely known [89].",

    "reference_summary": "These two appeals concern the claims of two EU nationals to claim benefits in the United Kingdom.\nMs Mirga was born in Poland and, having previously lived in the UK with her parents for four years, moved back here in 2004.\nThe benefit rights of people from Poland in the UK were mostly governed by the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1219) (the A8 Regulations) which were enacted to give effect to the Treaty on Accession 2003 (the Accession Treaty) under which Poland (and seven other countries) joined the EU.\nAfter finishing her education in April 2005, she carried out registered work within the meaning of the A8 Regulations for seven months.\nShe then became pregnant and did around three months of unregistered work.\nMs Mirga claimed income support in August 2006 under the Income Support (General) Regulations (SI 1987/1967) (the Income Support Regulations) on the grounds of pregnancy.\nThe Secretary of State refused Ms Mirgas application for income support and his decision was upheld by the First tier Tribunal.\nThe Upper Tribunal and then the Court of Appeal affirmed that decision, on the ground that Ms Mirga did not have a right of residence in the UK under the A8 Regulations and therefore was excluded from income support by the Income Support Regulations.\nMr Samin was born in Iraq in 1960.\nIn 1992, he and his family were granted asylum in Austria in 1992 and he was granted Austrian citizenship the following year.\nHe then became estranged from his wife and children and came to the UK in December 2005, since when he has lived here alone.\nWhere the A8 Regulations do not apply, the benefit rights of EU nationals in the UK are mostly governed by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) (the EEA Regulations), issued pursuant to EU Directive 2004/38/EC (the 2004 Directive).\nMr Samin is socially isolated and suffers from poor mental and physical health.\nMr Samin occupied private accommodation until 2010, when he applied to Westminster City Council (the Council) for housing under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1996 (the Housing Act).\nThe Council decided that he was a person from abroad who is not eligible for housing assistance within the meaning of section 185(1) of the Housing Act, because he did not have the right of residence in the UK under the EEA Regulations.\nThat decision was affirmed in the Central London County Court, whose decision was in turn upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses both Ms Mirgas and Mr Samins appeals for reasons set out in a judgment given by Lord Neuberger (with which Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke and Lord Reed agree).\nSubmissions of the parties The Secretary of State contended that the Court of Appeals decisions were right.\nAt the time she applied for it, Ms Mirga was ineligible for income support because she was a person from abroad, and could not claim to be a worker as she was an A8 national who had not done 12 months employment and thus could not qualify under the A8 Regulations.\nEven if the A8 Regulations did not apply, the Secretary of State argued, Ms Mirga would not have been a worker under the EEA Regulations as she had not worked for 12 months before claiming income support [36].\nIn respect of Mr Samin, the Council contended that he was not a worker within the EEA Regulations because he is now incapable of work and had not worked for 12 months in the UK [37].\nIn response to these contentions, two arguments were raised on behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin.\nThe first argument rested on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the TFEU).\nMs Mirga contended that, given her right to respect for family and private life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and given that she had been a worker, albeit not for the requisite period under the A8 Regulations (or the EEA Regulations), she could not be removed from the UK; accordingly, she contended, her right of residence under article 21.1 of TFEU could not lawfully be cut back by restricting her right to income support as the Income Support Regulations purport to do [38, 41].\nMr Samin argued that refusal of housing assistance to him constituted unlawful discrimination contrary to article 18.1 of the TFEU because such assistance would have been accorded to a citizen of the UK or a qualifying member from another member state who was in the same position as Mr Samin [39, 42].\nMs Mirgas alternative argument was that, even if the Income Support Regulations could have the effect for which the Secretary of State contended, it would only be so if it could be shown that providing her with income support would be disproportionate i.e. if it would place an unreasonable burden on the UK social assistance system, and there has been no inquiry into that question [38, 58].\nTo much the same effect, Mr Samins alternative argument was that the refusal of housing allowance to him could only be justified if it could be shown that the grant of such an allowance would be disproportionate and there had been no inquiry into that question [58].\nThe first issue: do the domestic Regulations infringe the appellants TFEU rights? The right accorded to Ms Mirga by article 21.1 of TFEU is qualified by the words subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the measures adopted to give them effect.\nIn the present case, the measures include the Accession Treaty and the 2004 Directive, and hence the A8 Regulations and the EEA Regulations respectively [43].\nA significant aim of these measures was to ensure that EU nationals from one member state should not be able to exercise their rights of residence in another member state so as to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system.\nFurther, any right of residence after three months can be subject to conditions, and EU nationals can be refused social assistance where appropriate [44].\nWhether the Accession Treaty or the 2004 Directive applied, Ms Mirga has not done 12 months work in the UK, and therefore cannot claim to be a worker, and she is not a jobseeker, self employed, a student or self sufficient.\nTherefore she can be validly denied a right of residence in the UK and can be excluded from social assistance.\nArticle 21.1 of TFEU therefore cannot assist her [45].\nThe article 18 right claimed by Mr Samin is limited to the scope of the Treaties, which means that it only comes into play where there is discrimination in connection with a right in the TFEU or another EU treaty.\nFurther, the right is without prejudice to any special provisions contained in the Treaties.\nTherefore, Mr Samins argument fails for the same reasons that Ms Mirgas does [47].\nExamination of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), especially Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig [2015] All ER (EC) 1 and Case C 67/14 Jobcenter Berlin Neukolin v Alimanovic clearly support this conclusion. [48 57] The second issue: the arguments based on lack of proportionality The argument that the determinations of the courts and tribunals below in relation to Ms Mirgas claim and Mr Samins claim were flawed because no consideration was given to the proportionality of refusing each of them social assistance is rejected.\nThe judgments of the CJEU relied on by the appellants do not support the argument [58 66].\nOn the other hand, the judgment and reasoning in Dano, supported by the judgment in Alimanovic undermine the argument [66, 67, 71].\nIt is unrealistic to require an individual examination of each particular case, as is recognised by the jurisprudence from the CJEU [68].\nWhere a national of another member state is not a worker, self employed or a student and had no, or very limited, means of support and no medical insurance, it would undermine the whole thrust of the 2004 Directive if proportionality could be invoked to entitle that person to have the right of residence and social assistance in another member state, save perhaps in extreme circumstances [69].\nIt would also place a substantial burden on a host member state if it had to carry out a proportionality exercise in every case where the right or residence or the right against discrimination was invoked [69].\nEven if there is a category of exceptional cases where proportionality would come into play, Mr Samin and Ms Mirga do not fall into it [70].",

    "reference_summary": "There is a recognised need for private pension schemes to provide some form of indexation of pensions to protect the value of members pensions against price inflation.\nTo this end, Barnardos adopted a pension scheme which provides for pensions in the course of payment to be increased by the prescribed rate, which is defined as an increase at the rate of the lesser of: (a) 5%, and (b) the percentage rise in the Retail Prices Index (if any) over the year ending on the previous 31 December.\nThe definition of Retail Prices Index lies at the heart of the dispute: Retail Prices Index means the General Index of Retail Prices published by the Department of Employment or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval.\nWhere an amount is to be increased in line with the Retail Prices Index over a period, the increase as a percentage of the original amount will be equal to the percentage increase between the figures in the Retail Prices Index published immediately prior to dates when the period began and ended, with an appropriate restatement of the later figure if the Retail Prices Index has been replaced or re based during the period (the Definition).\nThe critical clause in the Definition is or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval.\nBarnardos argues that this clause empowers the trustees to adopt another index which they consider a more suitable measure of price inflation (such as the Consumer Prices Index (the CPI)), regardless of whether or not the Retail Price Index (RPI) continues to be published.\nRepresentatives of members of the scheme, who are concerned that the adoption of the CPI as the index would over time reduce benefits which they receive from the scheme, argue that the clause does not empower the trustees to depart from the RPI for the purposes of the indexation if the RPI continues to be published.\nThe trustees adopt a neutral stance.\nThe trustees sought a ruling on the meaning of the Definition.\nThe High Court held that, on a proper construction, the Definition did not empower the trustees to adopt an index other than the RPI unless the RPI had been discontinued as an officially published index and replaced.\nBarnardos appealed this decision.\nThe Court of Appeal by majority (Lewison and McFarlane LLJ, Vos LJ dissenting) dismissed the appeal.\nBarnardos appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\nLord Hodge gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices agree.\nIn deciding which interpretative tools will best assist in ascertaining the meaning of a contract or trust, and the weight to be given to each of the relevant interpretative tools, English courts must have regard to the nature and circumstances of the particular instrument [13].\nA pension scheme has several distinctive characteristics which are relevant to the courts selection of the appropriate interpretative tools.\nFirst, it is a formal legal document which has been prepared by skilled and specialist legal draftsmen.\nSecondly, unlike many commercial contracts, it is not the product of commercial negotiation between parties who may have conflicting interests and who may conclude their agreement under considerable pressure of time.\nThirdly, it is an instrument which is designed to operate in the long term, defining peoples rights long after the economic and other circumstances, which existed at the time when it was signed, may have ceased to exist.\nFourthly, the scheme confers important rights on parties, the members of the pension scheme, who were not parties to the instrument and who may have joined the scheme many years after it was initiated.\nFifthly, members of a pension scheme may not have easy access to expert legal advice or be able readily to ascertain the circumstances which existed when the scheme was established [14].\nIn light of these characteristics, it is appropriate for the Court to give weight to textual analysis, by concentrating on the words which the draftsman has chosen to use and by attaching less weight to the background factual matrix than might be appropriate in certain commercial contracts [15].\nHowever, the emphasis on textual analysis as an interpretative tool does not derogate from the need both to avoid undue technicality and to have regard to the practical consequences of any construction.\nSuch an analysis does not involve literalism but includes a purposive construction when that is appropriate [16].\nThe Court is persuaded that the correct interpretation of the first sentence of the Definition is that RPI means the RPI or any index that replaces the RPI and is adopted by the trustees [19].\nThe Court reaches this view for the following eight reasons.\nFirst, the draftsman chose to use the word replacement which does not naturally suggest the selection of an alternative to an option which remains available.\nIt is, nonetheless, capable of bearing that meaning, and one must look to the context for guidance [20].\nSecondly, the word order and grammatical construction of the phrase a replacement adopted by the trustees suggest that the RPI must first be replaced and that the trustees adopt the replacement. [21].\nThirdly, the existence of a discretion on the part of the trustees and the requirement that the adoption should not prejudice the approval of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (CIR) do not militate against this view [22].\nFourthly, consistency within the rules of the scheme as a whole, and indeed within the Definition itself, would suggest that it is the relevant official authority and not the trustees who are to effect the replacement in the first sentence of the Definition [23].\nFifthly, the CIR guidance on approval of schemes does not assist because the draftsman has not chosen to use wording similar to that guidance in the Definition [25].\nSixthly, the superseded rules do not assist in interpreting the Definition [26].\nSeventhly, a provision which provides for the circumstance of the official replacement of a cost of living index does not lack a rational purpose [27].\nEighthly, while the requirement of indexation by reference to the RPI imposes obligations on Barnardos and contributes to the pension deficit at a time when many see the CPI as a more reliable index for the cost of living, the Court must construe the rules of the scheme without any preconceptions as to whether a construction should favour the sponsoring employer or the members [28].",

    "reference_summary": "On 4 January 2011, Mrs Sylvie Beghal passed through East Midlands Airport with her three children on returning from visiting her husband in Paris, a French national in custody on terrorist offences.\nShe was stopped by police and, although not formally detained, arrested or suspected of being a terrorist, was told they needed to speak to her to establish whether she was involved in terrorist acts.\nThe police did this exercising the power under Paragraph 2 of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which deals with questioning individuals at ports or borders for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be [or to have been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism].\nNo reasonable suspicion of a past or future offence is needed.\nUnder other provisions of Schedule 7, officers may also: require the production of documents carried; copy and retain material; and, search and detain (currently for a maximum of 6 hours) individuals.\nBy way of sanction, Paragraph 18 of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 makes it a criminal offence, on pain of fine and/or imprisonment, wilfully to fail to comply with such requirements.\nA Code of Practice exists for officers exercising these powers.\nMrs Beghal sent her two eldest children to the arrivals gate, asked for a lawyer (with whom she spoke on the phone) and requested and was granted an opportunity to pray.\nShe was searched and in the absence of the lawyer was asked, amongst other questions, about her relationship with her husband, her reasons for travel, where she had stayed and whether she had travelled beyond France.\nShe refused to answer most of the questions and was charged with the offence of wilful failure to comply with the requirement to answer questions.\nThe questions and reporting her for failure to answer them lasted under half an hour.\nShe later pleaded guilty to this offence and her sentence was a conditional discharge.\nMrs Beghal brought proceedings arguing that the Schedule 7 powers breached her Article 5 (right to liberty), Article 6 (privilege against self incrimination) and Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\nThe Divisional Court dismissed her claims.\nThe Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by a majority of 4 1 (Lord Kerr dissenting).\nLord Hughes delivers the lead judgment.\nLord Neuberger and Lord Dyson give a joint concurring opinion.\nPowers of questioning and search and inspecting, copying and retaining data on electronic devices Article 8 ECHR Questioning and search under compulsion undoubtedly constitutes an interference with Article 8(1) ECHR [28].\nAs to justification under Article 8(2) ECHR, it is in accordance with the law as there are sufficient safeguards and controls against overbroad and arbitrary use of this power [45].\nThese include, for example, the restrictions on the location, duration and type of questioning and search, the requirement to permit consultation with a solicitor, the availability of judicial review and the supervision\nof the Independent Reviewer of terrorism legislation [43].\nThe fact that questioning does not require objective grounds for suspicion does not by itself mean that the safeguards are inadequate [44].\nThe power is also proportionate: (i) questioning and search at ports is rationally connected to the proper objective of Schedule 7, which is preventing and detecting terrorism [47]; (ii) to require reasonable suspicion before using the power would not achieve anything like the same utility in fighting the threat of terrorism [49]; and, (iii) it also represents a fair balance between the rights of individuals and the interests of community at large; the level of intrusion is comparatively light and not beyond the reasonable expectations of international travellers and the importance of preventing and detecting acts of terrorism can scarcely be overstated [48, 51].\nThere is also no substantial risk of these powers being used on a racially discriminatory basis.\nThe statistics show that the exercise of Schedule 7 powers is proportionate to the terrorist population, considering the sources of the terrorist threat, that travels through UK ports [50].\nRetaining electronic data is a considerable intrusion into the private life of an individual [57].\nIt may well be that retention longer than an initial inspection for a reasonable period can only be justified if there exist objectively established grounds for suspicion [58].\nThis power, however, was not used in the case of Mrs Beghal.\nPower to detain Article 5 ECHR The power to detain for six hours falls within Article 5(1)(b) ECHR and involves a greater level of intrusion than questioning and search [52].\nNonetheless, restricting an individuals movement in order to exercise the questioning and search power, and for no more than is necessary, will either not be a deprivation of liberty or will be justified [54].\nThe better view is that detention beyond what is necessary to complete the process of questioning and search for example, for six hours can only be justified by objectively demonstrated suspicion [55].\nHowever, in this case any deprivation of Mrs Beghals liberty was for no longer than was necessary for the completion of the process [56].\nPrivilege against self incrimination Article 6 ECHR Schedule 7 excludes privilege against self incrimination as it is by necessary inference abrogated by the words of the statute [64].\nMoreover, the risk of prosecution based on answers to Schedule 7 is not a real and appreciable one; in practice section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) would inevitably render such evidence inadmissible.\nArticle 6 ECHR would also compel the same result [65 66].\nAs port questioning and search is not part of a criminal investigation, the individual is not a person charged for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR so that Article 6 ECHR has no application [69].\nLord Kerr (dissenting) would find that the Schedule 7 powers are incompatible with Articles 5, 6 and 8 ECHR: (i) they are not in accordance with the law.\nThe potential for arbitrary or discriminatory exercise of the powers is apparent from the Code of Practice [103 104].\nMoreover, a crucial element of this requirement is to make it possible to examine whether the powers have been used proportionately.\nWhere the Schedule 7 powers can be exercised without any suspicion whatsoever there is simply no material to judge whether they are being used proportionately [106]; (ii) the powers are greater than necessary to accomplish the aims; there is no evidence that such suspicion less powers are the only way to achieve the goal of combatting terrorism and no reasoned justification has been given for granting examining officers such powers [122, 124];

The Appellant objected and suggested mediation.\nMeanwhile, the Respondent decided privately to move with B to live in Pakistan where she says members of her wider family remain.\nShe did not share this decision with the Appellant.\nOn 3 February 2014 the Respondent moved to Pakistan with B where they have remained ever since.\nAlthough the Appellant did not consent to it, Bs removal to Pakistan was lawful.\nOn 13 February 2014, unaware where the Respondent had taken B, the Appellant applied under the Children Act 1989 (1989 Act) for orders for shared residence of B, or for contact with her.\nThis application depended upon showing that B was habitually resident in England at the time it was issued (i.e. 13 February 2014).\nSubsequently, having learned that the Respondent had taken B to Pakistan, the Appellant also applied for orders under the courts inherent jurisdiction over B (as a British national) that she be made a ward of court and returned to England.\nIn July 2014 Hogg J held that (a) the English court had no jurisdiction to determine the Appellants 1989 Act application because B had lost her habitual residence immediately upon her removal to Pakistan on 3 February 2014; and (b) the inherent jurisdiction over a British national who was neither habitually resident nor present in England should be exercised only if the circumstances were dire and exceptional, and this was not such a case.\nOn 6 August 2015, the Court of Appeal dismissed the Appellants appeal.\nThe Appellant appeals to the Supreme Court in respect of both applications.\nThe Supreme Court allows the appeal on the Appellants application under the 1989 Act by a majority of 3:2 (Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption dissenting) on the basis that B remained habitually resident in England on 13 February 2014.\nLord Wilson gives the lead judgment.\nHabitual residence\nLord Wilson (with whom Lady Hale and Lord Toulson agree) observes that two consequences flow from the modern international primacy of the concept of a childs habitual residence.\nFirst, it is not in the interests of children routinely to be left without a habitual residence [30].\nSecond, the English courts interpretation of the concept of habitual residence should be consonant with its international interpretation [31].\nThe present case, however, involved a third aspect of the concept of habitual residence: the circumstances in which a child loses his or her habitual residence [32].\nThe traditional English law approach to this issue is heavily dependent upon parental intention.\nIn particular, in In re J (A Minor), Lord Brandon observed that a person may cease to be habitually resident in a country in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return and settle elsewhere [33 34].\nLord Wilson notes that the Supreme Court in A v A held that the English concept of habitual residence should be governed by the criterion set out in the CJEU jurisprudence: namely, that there be some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment.\nThis focuses on the childs situation, with parental intention being merely one relevant factor [35 38].\nLord Wilson identifies two points in the CJEU jurisprudence relevant to the issue of when habitual residence is lost.\nFirst, the effect of Recital 12 to the Brussels II Regulation is that, where the interpretation of the concept of habitual residence can reasonably follow two paths, the courts should follow the path perceived better to serve the interests of children.\nSecond, the CJEU has indorsed the view that, although it is conceivable that a child may have no habitual residence, this will only be in exceptional cases [40 44].\nLord Wilson concludes that the modern concept of a childs habitual residence operates in such a way as to make it highly unlikely, albeit conceivable, that a child will be left without a habitual residence; the concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he or she loses their old one.\nLord Brandons observation in In Re J should no longer be regarded as correct, and Hogg J fell into error in being guided by it [45 47].\nLord Wilson therefore states that the correct question is whether B had by 13 February 2014 achieved the requisite degree of disengagement from her English environment [48].\nHe concludes that, taken cumulatively, the factors pointing to the conclusion that B had not by 13 February 2014 achieved the requisite degree of disengagement compel the conclusion that she retained habitual residence in England [49 50].\nAccordingly, the Appellants application under the 1989 Act can and should proceed to substantive determination by the High Court (Family Division) [51].\nLord Sumption (dissenting) considers that Hogg J made no error of law and, having heard and reviewed the evidence, was entitled to find that B lost her habitual residence in England on 3 February 2014 [64 80].\nLord Clarke agrees [89 95].\nInherent jurisdiction Given the majoritys conclusion on habitual residence, it is unnecessary to decide whether the inherent jurisdiction can be exercised.\nLady Hale and Lord Toulson observe that none of the reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the inherent jurisdiction has much force in this case.\nThey consider that the jurisdiction is not confined to exceptional circumstances; it could have been exercised if the court held that B required protection [59 62].\nLord Wilson agrees, but leaves open the question of whether it would have been appropriate to exercise the inherent jurisdiction in this case [53].\nLord Sumption (dissenting) considers that, unless the inherent jurisdiction is reserved for exceptional cases, it may be exercised in a manner which cuts across the statutory scheme.\nHe considers that the jurisdiction could not have been exercised in this case [81 87].\nLord Clarke, noting that the jurisdiction must be exercised with great caution, agrees that it should not be used on the facts of this case [96 97].\nThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Courts decision.\nIt does not form part of the reasons for the decision.\nThe full judgment of the Court is the only authoritative document.\nJudgments are public documents and are available at: http://supremecourt.uk/decided cases/index.html",

    "reference_summary": "These appeals raise important and difficult issues in the field of equity and trust law.\nBoth appeals raise issues about the so called rule in Hastings Bass, which is concerned with trustees who make decisions without having given proper consideration to relevant matters which they ought to have taken into account.\nIn addition, the appeal in Pitt raises issues as to the courts jurisdiction to set aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake.\nIn 1985, Mr Mark Futter made two settlements.\nInitially, both settlements had non resident trustees, until, in 2004, he and Mr Cutbill, both resident in the United Kingdom, were appointed.\nIn 2008, on the advice of solicitors, Mr Futter and Mr Cutbill, in exercise of a power of enlargement, distributed the whole capital of the first settlement to Mr Futter, and, in exercise of a power of advancement, distributed 36,000 from the second settlement to Mr Futters three children in equal shares.\nIn so doing, they overlooked the effect of section 2(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA), which resulted in a large capital gains tax liability for Mr Futter, and a modest one for his children.\nMr Futter and Mr Cutbill, as trustees of the two settlements, applied to have the deed of enlargement and the deeds of advancement declared void, which Norris J held them to be on the basis of the rule in Hastings Bass.\nIn 1990, Mr Derek Pitt suffered very serious head injuries in a road traffic accident, resulting in his mental incapacity.\nMr Pitts claim for damages for his injuries was compromised by a court approved settlement in the sum of 1.2m.\nMr Pitts solicitors sought advice from Frankel Topping, a firm of financial advisers.\nThey advised that the damages should be settled in a discretionary settlement.\nThis was done in 1994 by the establishment of the Derek Pitt Special Needs Trust (the SNT).\nThe SNT could have been established without any immediate inheritance tax liability, but it was not.\nThe report from Frankel Topping made no reference whatsoever to inheritance tax.\nIn 2007, Mr Pitt died.\nHis personal representatives, who were also two of the trustees of the SNT, commenced proceedings to have the SNT set aside, which the deputy judge ordered on the basis of the rule in Hastings Bass.\nHowever, in so doing, he indicated that, even if there had been a mistake of any sort, it was only a mistake as to the consequences of the transaction, rather than its effect, and so he would not have granted rescission of the SNT.\nThe Revenues appeals against these decisions were heard together in the Court of Appeal.\nLloyd LJ (with whom Longmore and Mummery LJJ agreed) (i) allowed the appeals, principally on the ground that the rule in Hastings Bass was not applicable, because the respective trustees acted reasonably in reliance on what they supposed to be competent professional advice, (ii) dismissed Mrs Pitts appeal based on mistake, on the basis that rescission for mistake could only be granted if there was a serious mistake as to nature of a transaction, rather than its consequences, and a mistake as to tax consequences was not a sufficient mistake for the purposes of rescission.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously (i) dismisses the appeal in Futter, and the appeal in Pitt, so far as they turn on the rule in Hastings Bass, (ii) allows the appeal in Pitt on the ground of mistake, and sets aside the SNT.\nLord Walker gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\nThe rule in Hastings Bass The rule in Hastings Bass, properly understood, depends on breach of duty in the performance of something that is within the scope of the trustees powers, not in the trustees doing something that they had no power to do at all [43].\nThe rule is centred on the failure of trustees to perform their decision making function.\nIt is that which founds the courts jurisdiction to intervene if it thinks fit to do so [91].\nAs a matter of principle there must be a high degree of flexibility in the range of the courts possible responses.\nTo lay down a rigid rule would inhibit the court in seeking the best practical solution in the application of the rule in Hastings Bass in a variety of different factual situations [92].\nFor the rule in Hastings Bass to apply, the inadequate deliberation on the part of the trustees must be sufficiently serious as to amount to a breach of fiduciary duty.\nIt is generally only a breach of duty on the part of the trustees that entitles the court to intervene.\nIt is not enough to show that the trustees deliberations have fallen short of the highest possible standards, or that the court would, on a surrender of discretion by the trustees, have acted in a different way.\nApart from exceptional circumstances (such as an impasse reached by honest and reasonable trustees) only breach of fiduciary duty justifies judicial intervention [73].\nHowever, where trustees have been in breach of duty by exercising a discretion with inadequate deliberation, setting aside their decision may not be the only course open to the court [63].\nIt would be contrary to principle and authority to impose a form of strict liability on trustees who conscientiously obtain and follow, in making a decision which is within the scope of their powers, apparently competent professional advice which turns out to be wrong [80].\nSuch a result cannot be achieved by the route of attributing any fault on the part of professional advisers to the trustees as their supposed principals [81].\nThere have been, and no doubt will be in the future, cases in which small variations in the facts lead to surprisingly different outcomes.\nThat is inevitable in an area where the law has to balance the need to protect beneficiaries against aberrant conduct by trustees (the policy behind the rule in Hastings Bass) with the competing interests of legal certainty, and of not imposing too stringent a test in judging trustees decision making [83].\nRescission on the ground of mistake The true requirement for rescission on the ground of mistake is simply for there to be a causative mistake of sufficient gravity.\nThe test will normally be satisfied only when there is a mistake either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction, or as to some matter of fact or law which is basic to the transaction [122].\nConsequences (including tax consequences) are relevant to the gravity of a mistake [132].\nA mistake must be distinguished from mere ignorance, inadvertence, and misprediction [104].\nForgetfulness, inadvertence or ignorance is not, as such, a mistake, but it can lead to a false belief or assumption which the law will recognise as a mistake [105].\nMere ignorance, even if causative, is insufficient [108].\nHowever, the distinctions may not be clear on the facts of a particular case [109].\nIn order to satisfy the test for setting aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake, the gravity of the mistake must be assessed by a close examination of the facts.\nThe injustice of leaving a mistaken disposition uncorrected must be evaluated objectively, but with an intense focus on the facts of the particular case [126].\nThe court must make an evaluative judgment whether it would be unconscionable, or unjust, to leave the mistake uncorrected, and form a judgment about the justice of the case [128].\nMrs Pitt had an incorrect conscious belief, or made an incorrect tacit assumption, that the proposed SNT had no adverse tax effects [133].\nThe SNT could have complied with statutory requirements without any artificiality or abuse of statutory relief.\nIt was precisely the sort of trust to which Parliament intended to grant relief [134].",

applies to settlements of property made by parents for their children, and is subject to statutory exceptions.\nThe rule against excessive accumulation has been abolished altogether.\nBut the principle remains that a disposition of property which is partly invalid is not wholly invalid.\nThe question is how far the invalid parts can be severed from the rest.\nThe answer depends on the

    "reference_summary": "This is an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case in which the appellants are defendants indicted for offences of unauthorised use of trademarks, contrary to section 92(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (the 1994 Act).\nAn offence is committed under that section where a person does any of the following three things (with the intent to gain or to cause loss, and without the consent of the trademark proprietor): (a) applies to goods a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark, (b) sells goods which bear such a sign, or (c) possesses in the course of a business any such goods with a view to committing an offence under (b).\nThe allegations against the appellants (which have yet to be proved) are that they are engaged in the bulk import and subsequent sale of goods bearing registered trademarks, manufactured abroad, in countries outside the EU.\nA significant portion of the goods said to be sold by the appellants were manufactured (and the trademark applied) with the permission of the trademark proprietor, but were then sold without the trademark proprietors consent (for example because the goods were in excess of the numbers or below the quality permitted by the trademark proprietor).\nThe appellant describes these as grey market goods and distinguishes them from true counterfeits manufactured without the authorisation of the trademark proprietor.\nAt a preparatory hearing in the Crown Court, the appellants argued that while the sale of grey goods attracts civil liability, it is not covered by the offence in s.92(1), which properly construed applies only to true counterfeits.\nThe appellants argued that such a sign in subsection (1)(b) refers back to (1)(a), so that 1(b) applies only to goods where the trademark has been applied without the consent of the proprietor.\nAny goods in the grey market category have had the trademark originally applied with the consent of the proprietor.\nIt is only the sale which the proprietor has not authorised.\nIt follows, they contend, that they are not, when it comes to paragraph (b), goods which bear such a sign.\nBoth the trial judge and the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rejected that submission.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals.\nLord Hughes gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.\nSo called grey market goods are caught by the criminal offence in s.92(1), and the appellants contended construction of that section must be rejected.\nThe plain reading of such a sign in (1)(b) is that it refers back to the sign mentioned in (1)(a) i.e. a sign which is identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark. 1(b) therefore covers the unauthorised sale of any\ngoods bearing a trademark (regardless of whether the trademark was applied to the goods in their manufacture with consent or not).\nBut this reference back to (1)(a) does not also incorporate into the meaning of such a sign the commission of an offence under (1)(a), i.e. the requirement that the sign has been applied without the consent of the proprietor.\nSuch a reading of (1)(b) is strained and unnatural and requires one to read such sign as such a sign, so applied.\nThe offences set out in (a), (b) and (c) are not cumulative, but separate, and the requirement in the opening lines of s.92(1) that the use made of the sign is without the consent of the proprietor applies to each type of use specified whether it is the application of a trademark to goods, the sale of goods bearing a trademark, or the possession for sale of goods bearing a trademark. [8 12] The predecessor of section 92, section 58A of the Trademarks Act 1938, also plainly covered grey market goods.\nThe appellants contention therefore that the more stringent test for intention in s.58A had the practical effect of confining criminal liability to cases of their category of true counterfeits must be rejected. [16 17] There is therefore no ambiguity in the language of the section to justify investigating the Parliamentary debate at the passing of the 1994 Act.\nIn any event, the appellants did not contend that Parliament considered a difference between true counterfeits and grey market goods.\nStill less is there any point at which it can be suggested that Parliament plainly confined itself to criminalising fake goods and abjured the criminalising of grey market goods.\nThe authorities relied on by the appellants in support of their contention that such a distinction was plainly intended do not assist here, as they were not addressing any difference between fake goods and unauthorised goods on the grey market, and moreover came years after the passage of the 1994 Act so could not have been in mind at the time of its passing. [13 14] The appellants are correct that in the context of goods which a proprietor voluntarily puts into the European single market with his trademark attached, section 12 of the 1994 Act, transposing article 7 of Directive 89/104/EEC, has the effect that further objection to the use of the mark is limited to special cases, such as changes or impairments to the goods.\nBut that is true whichever of the rival constructions of section 92 is correct.\nWhere it applies, this concept of exhaustion means that there is no infringement of the mark as a matter of civil law, and thus no criminal offence.\nBut this sheds no light on the correct construction of section 92. [15] There is no reason to strain the construction of s.92(1) to exclude the sale of grey market goods.\nThis is not because of the supposedly adverse consequences which the Crown argued would follow, some of which would be as likely to ensue even on the correct interpretation of the section.\nThe distinction between the two categories suggested by the appellant is not cut and dried, but both are clear infringements of the rights of the trademark proprietor.\nThe plain meaning of the Act is that it is unlawful to put grey goods on the market just as it is to put fake ones on there.\nIn both cases the trader is setting out to profit from someone elses trademark without permission. [18] In the alternative, the appellants contend that the Crowns construction of section 92(1) involves a disproportionate breach of their rights under article 1, Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBut the 1994 Act does not deprive them of their property, as it does not stop them selling the goods, except if they wish to do so whilst still with the misleading and infringing trademark attached.\nSuch regulation of use or disposal of goods is permitted under the second paragraph of article 1 in the general interest, and is in any event a proportionate measure, striking a legitimate balance between the rights of the proprietor to protect his valuable trademark, and those of the person who wishes to sell good which he has bought.

    "reference_summary": "The issue is whether the ban on the entry for settlement of foreign spouses or civil partners unless both parties are aged 21 or over, contained in paragraph 277 of the Immigration Rules, was a lawful way of deterring or preventing forced marriages.\nParagraph 277 of the Immigration Rules [Paragraph 277] was amended with effect from 27 November 2008 to raise the minimum age for a person either to be granted a visa for the purposes of settling in the United Kingdom as a spouse or to sponsor another for the purposes of obtaining such a visa from 18 to 21.\nThe purpose of the amendment was not to control immigration but to deter forced marriages.\nA forced marriage is a marriage into which at least one party enters without her or his free and full consent through force or duress, including coercion by threats or other psychological means.\nMr Quila, a Chilean national, entered into a fully consensual marriage with Ms Jeffery, a British citizen.\nMr Aguilar Quila applied for a marriage visa before the amendment took effect, but his application was refused as his wife was only 17 and a sponsoring spouse had to be 18.\nBy the time that Ms Jeffrey had turned 18 the amendment was in force and the Home Office refused to waive it.\nConsequently, Mr Quila and his wife were forced to leave the UK initially to live in Chile (his wife having had to relinquish a place to study languages at Royal Holloway, University of London) and subsequently to live in Ireland.\nBibi (as she invited the Court to describe her) is a Pakistani national who applied to join her husband, Mohammed, a British citizen, in the UK.\nBibi and Mohammed had an arranged marriage in Pakistan in October 2008, to which each of them freely consented.\nTheir application was refused as both parties were under 21.\nThe Respondents claims for judicial review of the decisions were both rejected in the High Court.\nThe Respondents successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, which declared that the application of Paragraph 277 so as to refuse them marriage visas was in breach of their rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 [the ECHR].\nThe Secretary of State has appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court, by a 4 1 majority, dismisses the Secretary of States appeal on the grounds that the refusal to grant marriage visas to the Respondents was an infringement of their rights under Article 8 ECHR.\nLord Wilson gives the leading judgment; Lady Hale gives a concurring judgment.\nLord Phillips and Lord Clarke agree with Lord Wilson and Lady Hale.\nLord Brown gives a dissenting judgment.\nArticle 8 ECHR was engaged [43; 72].\nApplying R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, the relevant question was whether there had been an interference by a public authority with the exercise of a persons right to respect for his private or family life and if so, whether it had had consequences of sufficient gravity to engage the operation of the article [30].\nUnconstrained by authority,\nLord Wilson would have considered it a colossal interference to require for up to three years either that the spouses should live separately or that a British citizen should leave the UK for up to three years [32].\nThe ECtHR in Abdulaziz v United Kingdom (1985) 7 EHRR 471 has, however, held that there was no lack of respect for family life in denying entry to foreign spouses.\nThere was no positive obligation on the State to respect a couples choice of country of matrimonial residence [35 36].\nLord Wilson holds that Abdulaziz should not be followed in this respect; there was dissent at the time and no clear and consistent subsequent jurisprudence from the ECtHR as four more recent decisions [38 41] were inconsistent with the decision [43].\nThe ECtHR has since recognized that the distinction between positive and negative obligations should not generate different outcomes [43].\nThe Secretary of State has failed to establish that the interference with the Respondents rights to a family life was justified under Article 8(2) ECHR.\nParagraph 277 has a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of those who might be forced into marriage [45] and is rationally connected to that objective, but its efficacy is highly debatable [58].\nA number of questions remain unanswered including how prevalent the motive of applying for UK citizenship is in the genesis of forced marriages; whether the forced marriage would have occurred in any event and thus the rule increase the control of victims abroad and whether the amendment might precipitate a swift pregnancy in order to found an application for a discretionary grant of a visa [49].\nThe Secretary of State has failed to adduce any robust evidence that the amendment would have any substantial deterrent effect [50; 75].\nBy contrast, the number of forced marriages amongst those refused a marriage visa had not been quantified [53].\nThe only conclusion that could be drawn was that the amendment would keep a very substantial number of bona fide young couples apart or forced to live outside the UK [54], vastly exceeding the number of forced marriages that would be deterred [58; 74].\nThe measure was similar to the blanket prohibition on persons subject to immigration control marrying without the Secretary of States written permission found to be unlawful in R (Baiai) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 53 [57, 78 79].\nThe Secretary of State has failed to exercise her judgement on this imbalance and thus failed to establish both that the measure is no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective of deterring forced marriage and that it strikes a fair balance between the rights of parties to unforced marriages and the interests of the community in preventing forced marriage.\nOn any view, the measure was a sledgehammer but the Secretary of State has not attempted to identify the size of the nut [58].\nLady Hale holds that the debate on Abdulaziz is something of a red herring as the Secretary of State could not simultaneously state that the measure was not for the purpose of controlling immigration and rely upon jurisprudence wholly premised on the States right to control immigration [72].\nShe further holds that the restriction was automatic and indiscriminate [74]; failed to detect forced marriages and imposed a delay on cohabitation in the country of choice, which was a deterrent that could impair the essence of the right to marry under Article 12 ECHR [78 79].\nWhilst the judgment is essentially individual, it is hard to conceive that the Secretary of State could avoid infringement of Article 8 ECHR when applying Paragraph 277 to an unforced marriage [59; 80].\nLord Brown, dissenting, holds the extent of forced marriage is impossible to quantify so the deterrent effect of Paragraph 277 could never be satisfactorily determined [87].\nThe judgement of how to balance the enormity of suffering within forced marriages with the disruption to innocent couples was one for elected politicians, not for judges [91].\nThe measure was not an automatic indiscriminate restriction [92]; would be disapplied in exceptional circumstances [93] and similar rules applied in other European countries [85].\nTo disapply the rule would exceed ECtHR jurisprudence and in such a sensitive context, government policy should not be frustrated except in the clearest cases [97].",

    "reference_summary": "This appeal concerns the principle that an individual extradited to the UK to face trial may only be tried for crimes allegedly committed before the extradition if those crimes form the basis of the extradition request (the specialty principle), and its application to contempt of court proceedings.\nIn 2009 Mr OBrien came under investigation on suspicion of involvement in a large scale scheme to defraud investors, commonly known as a boiler room fraud.\nOn 24 September 2009 the Common Serjeant of London made a restraint order against him under section 41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).\nThis order required Mr OBrien (amongst other things) to make disclosure of his assets, not to remove assets from England and Wales, and to return to England and Wales within 21 days any moveable asset in which he had an interest outside England and Wales.\nThe order contained a penal notice, warning Mr OBrien that if he disobeyed the order he could be found to be in contempt of court.\nMr OBrien disobeyed the order and fled to the United States.\nOn 18 December 2009 the Common Serjeant found that he was in contempt and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.\nMr OBrien was traced to Chicago.\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sought his extradition to face charges relating to the alleged boiler room fraud.\nMr OBrien consented to his extradition on 8 October 2010.\nSince there was a concern that the outstanding bench warrant could complicate the extradition, the SFO applied to the Common Serjeant to set aside the bench warrant, which he did on 18 November 2010.\nMr OBrien was returned to the UK on 2 December 2010.\nHe was arrested, charged with various fraud offences, and remanded in custody.\nMeanwhile the SFO had reviewed its concerns about the contempt allegation, and re applied to the Common Serjeant for Mr OBriens committal for contempt.\nMr OBrien challenged the courts jurisdiction to hear the application.\nThat challenge was rejected by the Common Serjeant and by the Court of Appeal.\nMr OBrien now appeals to the Supreme Court on two grounds, namely that: On the correct construction of the Extradition Act 2003, the specialty rule applies to any extradition offence, defined as conduct occurring in the UK and punishable under the law of the UK with imprisonment or detention for 12 months or more (by reference to sections 148 and 151A of the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act)).\nMr OBriens contempt satisfies these criteria and so falls within the specialty rule; or In the alternative, Mr OBriens contempt of court is a criminal contempt constituting a criminal offence, and so falls within the specialty rule.\nThe Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.\nThe judgment of the Court is given by Lord Toulson.\nOn the first issue, the Court holds that section 151A does not directly apply to this case [34 35].\nIn any event, the sections relied upon by Mr OBrien cannot be read in isolation, and reading the Act as a whole it is clear\nthat conduct constituting an extradition offence must be a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state (here the UK) [36].\nOn the second issue, the Court holds that there is a material distinction between civil and criminal contempt.\nThe latter involves a serious interference with the administration of justice [41].\nThe former is an inherent power used by a senior court in order to ensure that its orders are observed.\nIts primary purpose is to ensure that the courts orders are observed, and the contemnor does not acquire a criminal record [39 40].\nIn this case Mr OBriens disobedience to the Common Serjeants order constitutes civil contempt, which does not constitute an extradition offence [45].\nFirst Ground: Mr OBrien argued that if his contempt satisfied the definition of extradition offence in section 148 of the 2003 Act, section 151A precluded a United Kingdom court dealing with him for that contempt [14 16].\nMr OBriens argument required reading these two sections in isolation.\nHowever, it is necessary to see how those sections fit into the structure of the 2003 Act [20].\nEach of Parts 1 3 of the 2003 Act contain a similar definition of extradition offence, in each case referring to conduct punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment, with a common structure across the definitions [21].\nThe Extradition Act 1989 was replaced by the 2003 Act in order to implement, in Part 1 of the 2003 Act, an EU Framework Decision [22].\nUnder the Framework Decision, it is a prerequisite of a valid arrest warrant that the conduct of which the person is accused or has been convicted constitutes a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state [25].\nIn relation to Part 1 (dealing with extradition from the UK to other Member States), the definition of extradition offence accordingly requires that an offence either be a listed extraditable offence or an offence under the law of the United Kingdom [28].\nA similar scheme is in place in relation to extradition from the UK to those non EU countries with which the UK has extradition arrangements, governed by Part 2 of the 2003 Act.\nSo, sections 137 and 138 of the 2003 Act require that an extradition offence concerns conduct which would constitute an offence under UK law [29 30].\nThat accords with the essential nature of extradition as it has been understood in the UK [31 33].\nPart 3 of the 2003 Act deals with extradition to the UK. section 148 (within Part 3) has no direct application to this case, since the UK judiciary is not involved in the process of obtaining Mr OBriens extradition [35].\nNonetheless section 151A should be understood in the light of the wider scheme of the 2003 Act.\nIt is clear that nothing can constitute an extradition offence unless it is a criminal offence under the relevant state, here the UK [36].\nSecond Ground: A restraint order under POCA is an interim remedy, aiming to prevent the disposal of realisable assets during a criminal investigation.\nThe Crown Court has an inherent jurisdiction to treat breach of such orders as contempt of court [37 38].\nThere is a well recognised distinction between criminal contempt, covering conduct itself a crime, and civil contempt, covering conduct which is not itself a crime but is punishable by the court in order that the courts orders be observed.\nA civil contemnor does not receive a criminal record [39 41].\nIf a victim of Mr OBriens fraud had obtained a freezing order against him similar to the POCA restraint order and Mr OBrien had disobeyed and absconded, the victim would clearly have been able to bring contempt proceedings following his extradition [43].\nThere is no relevant difference with a POCA order.\nThe key is the nature and purpose of the order, not the court in which the order was made [44].\nMr OBriens contempt was civil, and his committal is not barred by the specialty principle.",

    "reference_summary": "A patient, who was clinically asymptomatic at the time, requested that his GP refer him for a heart screen on 30 May 2008.\nThe GP referred him for an electrocardiogram (ECG) test in July 2008.\nThe test reported negative for ischaemic heart disease, and no further action was taken.\nThe patient made further complaints of chest pain to a locum doctor on 10 December 2008, and so his GP referred him to a chest pain clinic 5 days later.\nThe clinic declined to see him because of his earlier negative test, and sent a report to the practice on 20 December, which was not marked urgent or reviewed.\nThe patient attended the practice again on 6 January 2009 enquiring as to why he had not received an appointment.\nThe GP referred him for another ECG, but the patient died of a myocardial infarction later that day.\nThe patients widow complained to the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints (the Complaints Commissioner).\nFollowing an investigation, the Commissioner held that the practice had failed to provide a reasonable level of care and treatment and was guilty of maladministration.\nHe recommended that the GP make a payment of 10,000 to the widow.\nThe GP refused to make the payment, and so the Commissioner indicated that he would lay a special report about the matter before the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nThe Commissioners recommendation was upheld at first instance but quashed by a majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThe Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal by the Complaints Commissioner, holding that the Commissioner had (i) no power to recommend the payment of a money sum against an individual who was not a public authority in an investigation under article 8 of the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 and (ii) no power to make a special report drawing the attention of the legislature to such a persons failure to comply with a recommendation.\nLord Sumption gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\nThe Complaints Commissioners power to investigate the complaint were derived from article 8 of the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which deals with complaints against individuals, like the GP in this case, providing professional services under contracts or other consensual arrangements with the NHS [11].\nThe short answer to this appeal is that the Complaints Commissioner may not, under article 9 of the 1996 Order, carry out any investigations in respect of which the complainant has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law, unless it is not reasonable to expect the complainant to resort to law.\nThe widow had such a remedy but the Commissioner proceeded with the investigation because she\nsaid that she only wished to find out what had gone wrong (and not to obtain money).\nIt was not open to the Commissioner, having proceeded on that basis, to recommend a payment to her [17].\nMore generally, the Complaints Commissioner does not have the power to recommend monetary redress against individuals in investigations under article 8.\nThis is because his recommendations are not binding as a matter of private law, and a private individual such as a GP has no relevant duties in public law.\nFurthermore, a private individual has no means of effectively challenging the Commissioners findings on the merits of the case before a court [20, 24].\nNor does the Complaints Commissioner have a power to make a special report in default of payment.\nWhilst the Parliamentary Commissioner and Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland have such a power as against departments or public bodies that have been ordered to provide financial redress, the Complaints Commissioner does not.\nThis is because the Commissioners relationship with the legislature is different to that of other statutory ombudsmen in the United Kingdom.\nThe Commissioner is not an officer of the legislature, unlike the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, but receives complaints from and reports to the complainant and individuals or bodies whose conduct is at issue.\nHe has no powers of compulsion, and limited powers to use information discovered during investigations for the purposes of enforcement [20 21, 26 28].\nArticle 19 of the 1996 Order is concerned with the presentation of annual reports before the Assembly, and not reports on individual cases such as this [29].\nLord Sumption further comments on the substance of the Commissioners recommendation that the GP pay 10,000 to the widow.\nA monetary recommendation must be rational and capable of explanation.\nThe figure in the Commissioners report appears to have been plucked out of the air: it does not offer a coherent explanation or calculation, or identify the precise failings in respect of which it was made [30].",
    "predicted_summary": "The issues\nThe principal issues raised by this appeal are: (1) Whether the Commissioner has power to recommend the payment of a money sum to a complainant. (2) If so, whether the Commissioner has power to make a special report to the Northern Ireland legislature if the respondent declines to pay the amount recommended. (3) If the Commissioner does not have power to make such a report, whether the respondent is entitled to decline to pay the amount recommended. (4) If the Commissioner does have power to make such a report, whether the respondent is entitled to decline to pay the amount recommended. (5) If the respondent is entitled to decline to pay the amount recommended, whether the Commissioner must nevertheless make a special report to the Northern Ireland legislature. (6) If the Commissioner is entitled to make a special report, whether the respondent is entitled to challenge the making of such a report. (7) If the respondent is entitled to challenge the making of such a report, whether the courts have power to quash it. (8) If the courts have power to quash it, whether they should do so in this case. The relevant provisions of the 1996 Order are set out in full in the appendix to this judgment. The background to the legislation is well summarised by Lord Hope of Craighead in the Court of Session in the case of Scottish Information Commissioner v JJ (Scotland) [2010] CSIH 80, paras 12 16. The history of the legislation is also discussed in the judgment of Sir John Mummery P in the Court of Appeal in the present case, [2013] EWCA Civ 1336, paras 13 17. It is sufficient to say here that the legislation was enacted in response to the recommendations of the Franks Committee, which was appointed in 1955 to consider the possibility of establishing an official investigator of complaints against government departments. The committee published its report in 1957, and it was largely adopted by the government. In 1967, the government introduced the Parliamentary Commissioner Act, which established the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. This was followed by the establishment of commissioners for complaints against local government and the National Health Service. The legislation was amended in 1997 to enable the commissioner to investigate complaints against the merits of decisions taken in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgement. The legislation was consolidated in the 1996 Order, which applies to Northern Ireland. The legislation has undergone several amendments since then. The legislation is now being reviewed by the UK Government. The legislation is based on the principle that the ombudsman should be able to investigate complaints against government departments and other public bodies without fear or favour. The legislation is intended to promote good administration and to ensure that citizens receive fair treatment when dealing with government departments and other public bodies.

    "reference_summary": "This appeal concerns the question of whether article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (article 8) requires UK courts to consider the proportionality of evicting an occupier from his home in claims for possession by local authorities and, if so, whether the demoted tenancy regime in the Housing Acts 1985 and 1996 (the 1985 Act and 1996 Act respectively) can properly be interpreted so as to comply with the requirements of article 8.\nMost residential occupiers of local authority properties are secure tenants under Part IV of the 1985 Act who cannot be evicted other than pursuant to the grounds in section 84 of the 1985 Act.\nThe Anti Social Behaviour Act 2003 Act gave the courts power, however, to remove this security of tenure by making a demotion order.\nA demoted tenancy will last for a year and then revert to being a secure tenancy, unless within that year the landlord brings possession proceedings under section 143D of the 1996 Act effectively requesting a court to end the demoted tenancy.\nSection 143D(2) provides that the court must make an order for possession unless it thinks that the procedure under sections 143E and 143F has not been followed.\nUnder sections 143E and 143F of the 1996 Act, before issuing possession proceedings against a demoted tenant, the landlord must serve a notice informing the tenant, inter alia, of its decisions (with reasons why) to seek possession and, if so requested by the tenant, must carry out a review of its decision.\nThe Appellant, Cleveland Pinnock, is a demoted tenant.\nHe contests a possession order made against him under section 143D.\nMr Pinnock has lived in a property owned by the Respondent local authority, Manchester City Council (the Council), for over 30 years with his partner, Ms Walker, and, from time to time, with all or some of their five children.\nThe demotion order was made on the basis of a number of incidents of serious anti social behaviour caused by all members of Mr Pinnocks family (other than Mr Pinnock himself) at or near the property.\nA day before the effective lapse of the demoted tenancy, the Council served a notice under section 143E seeking possession of the property and citing further incidents of anti social behaviour by Mr Pinnocks sons which had occurred after the demotion order.\nA review under section 143F effectively upheld the Councils possession notice.\nThe Council then issued a claim for possession in the Manchester County Court.\nFollowing a two day hearing, the court granted an order for possession of the property.\nMr Pinnock appealed to the Court of Appeal, who dismissed his appeal.\nMr Pinnock then appealed to the Supreme Court.\nMr Pinnocks main contention is that the possession order violates his right to respect for his home under article 8 as it is disproportionate.\nIn view of the previous line of the House of Lords authorities, both the Manchester County Court and the Court of Appeal rejected Mr Pinnocks article 8 arguments on the basis that it was not open to them to review the Councils decision on the ground that it was disproportionate.\nApproaching the matter on a domestic law basis, both courts concluded that the Councils decision to seek possession was rational.\nIn a judgment of the Court delivered by Lord Neuberger, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal (but for different reasons from those of the County Court and the Court of Appeal).\nThe Court identified four issues of increasing specificity facing the court in this appeal [21]: (1) whether the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) requires domestic courts to consider the proportionality of evicting a person from his home before making an order for possession; (2) if so, the general implications of this conclusion in practice for claims for possession; (3) the implications of this conclusion on the compatibility of the statutory demoted tenancy regime with the Convention; and (4) the application of conclusions (1) (3) above to the facts of Mr Pinnocks appeal.\nIn light of the clear and constant line of jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the Court departed from the previous line of the House of Lords authorities and concluded that a court, which is asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a persons home, must have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order and, in making that assessment, to resolve any factual disputes between the parties [49], [74].\nThe Court emphasised that this conclusion relates to possession claims by local authorities and is not intended to bear on cases where the person seeking possession is a private landlord, which issue will have to be determined when it arises [50].\nThe Court noted that the appeal involved a comparatively rare type of possession claim, a claim against a demoted tenant.\nNevertheless, the Court was able to make certain general points [61] [64]: (1) article 8 only comes into play where a persons home is involved; (2) as a general rule, the proportionality of seeking possession will only need to be considered if the point is raised by the occupier concerned; (3) any article 8 defence should initially be considered summarily; (4) even where an outright order for possession is valid under domestic law, article 8 may justify granting an extended period for possession, suspending any possession order or refusing an order altogether; (5) the conclusion that the court must have the ability to consider the article 8 proportionality of making a possession order may require certain statutory and procedural provisions to be revisited; and (6) article 8 proportionality is more likely to be relevant in respect of occupiers who are vulnerable, due to either a mental or a physical disability.\nThe Court went on to conclude that it was possible to read and give effect to section 143D(2) in a way that would permit the court to review the proportionality of a landlords decision to seek possession and, if necessary, to make its own assessment of facts in dispute.\nIn particular, he concluded that, by virtue of section 7(1) of the Human Rights Act, County Court judges have the necessary jurisdiction to carry out the article 8 proportionality review [77] [80].\nIt therefore followed that the demoted tenancy regime is compatible with the Convention [104].\nGiven the above conclusions, the Court went on to consider whether it was proportionate to evict Mr Pinnock and his family from the property in light of their article 8 Convention rights.\nHaving regard to the undisputed evidence of three serious offences committed by Mr Pinnocks sons in, or in the vicinity of, the property during the year when the demotion order was in force, the Court concluded that the possession order against Mr Pinnock was indeed proportionate and should be upheld [127] [132].",

    "reference_summary": "This appeal concerns the permissibility of a procedure whereby a claimant in employment tribunal proceedings may be excluded along with his representatives from certain aspects of those proceedings on grounds of national security.\nIn particular the question arises as to whether such a procedure, known as a closed material procedure, is compatible with European Union law and the European Convention on Human Rights.\nMr Tariq was employed as an immigration officer with the Home Office until 2006 when he was suspended and his security clearance withdrawn.\nThe background for these decisions was the arrest of Mr Tariqs brother and cousin during an investigation into a suspected plot to mount a terrorist attack on transatlantic flights.\nMr Tariqs cousin was convicted in 2008 of various offences in relation to that plot.\nNo information suggested that Mr Tariq had himself been involved in any terrorism plot.\nMr Tariq commenced proceedings in the Employment Tribunal claiming direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of race and religion.\nHe alleged that the Home Office had relied on stereotypical assumptions about him, Muslims and individuals of Pakistani origin such as susceptibility to undue influence and that the Home Office had indirectly discriminatory policies and procedures.\nThe Home Office denied this and stated that its decisions were based on Mr Tariqs association with individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities and the risk of their attempting to exert influence on him to abuse his position.\nSection 10(6) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations that enable a tribunal to adopt a closed material procedure if it considers this expedient in the interests of national security.\nRule 54(2) of Schedule 1 to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2004 (the Regulations) provides for the adoption of a closed material procedure if the tribunal so orders.\nSchedule 2 provides for the use of special advocates, whose role is to represent a claimants interests so far as possible in relation to the aspects closed to him and his representatives.\nThe Employment Tribunal made an order for a closed material procedure, directing that Mr Tariq and his representatives should be excluded from the proceedings when closed evidence or documents were being considered.\nMr Tariq appealed the order to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.\nThe appeal was dismissed and a further appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, declared that Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights required Mr Tariq to be provided with the allegations being made against him in sufficient detail to enable him to give instructions to his legal team so that those allegations can be challenged effectively.\nThis requirement is known as gisting.\nThe Home Office appealed to the Supreme Court against the declaration and Mr Tariq cross appealed against the conclusion that a closed material procedure was permissible.\nThe Supreme Court by a majority of 8 1 allows the Home Offices appeal and sets aside the declaration made by the Court of Appeal requiring the provision of a gist.\nLord Kerr dissents.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Tariqs cross appeal, holding that a closed material procedure is compatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and EU Law.\nMr Tariqs Cross Appeal The issue in the cross appeal was whether the provisions in the Regulations providing for a closed material procedure were contrary to EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights.\nIt is a basic principle of EU law that national law should provide effective legal protection of EU law rights.\nThose rights include the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of race or religion.\nAs to whether the closed material procedure provided effective legal protection, the case law of the European Court of Justice is clear that EU law will look for guidance on the subject in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.\nThat Court has established in a line of cases culminating in Kennedy v UK that the demands of national security may necessitate a system for determining complaints under which a claimant is, for reasons of national security, unable to know the secret material by reference to which his complaint is determined.\nThe tests are whether the system is necessary and whether it contains sufficient safeguards.\nOn the facts, both were satisfied.\nThe system was necessary because security vetting is a highly sensitive area in which integrity of sources of information and the means of obtaining it must be protected.\nThe alternatives of the Home Office routinely having to pay unmeritorious claims or the courts refusing to hear claims at all are not possibilities that the law should readily contemplate.\nThe rule of law must, so far as possible, stand for the objective resolution of civil disputes on their merits by a court which has before it material enabling it to do so.\nThe system contained sufficient safeguards in the form of special advocates, who can usefully protect the claimants interests.\nFor these reasons the use of the closed material procedure in this case was lawful and the cross appeal must be dismissed.\nThe Home Offices Appeal The question in the appeal was whether there is an absolute requirement that a claimant should be able to see the allegations against him in sufficient detail to give instructions to his legal team to enable the allegations to be challenged effectively.\nMr Tariq argued that the European Convention on Human Rights contained such a principle.\nThe Supreme Court, however, held that the line of cases culminating in Kennedy v UK recognised that there was no absolute requirement.\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides the right to a fair trial.\nThe European Court of Human Rights has held that where the liberty of the subject is involved, Article 6 requires the provision of a gist as described by the Court of Appeal.\nIn cases such as the present not involving the liberty of the subject, however, the question is whether the use of the closed material procedure will impair the very essence of the right to a fair trial.\nThat cannot be said to be so in this case, as Mr Tariqs claim will be determined by an independent and impartial tribunal and the disadvantages that the procedure gives rise to will as far as possible be minimised.\nThe appeal was therefore allowed.\nLord Kerr dissented.\nHe held, first, that the withholding of information from a claimant which is then deployed to defeat his claim is a breach of his fundamental common law right to a fair trial.\nThe removal of that right can only be achieved by legislation framed in unambiguous language.\nSecondly, such withholding also constitutes a breach of a claimants Article 6 right to a fair trial.\nKennedy v UK was an anomaly.\nLord Kerr would therefore have dismissed the appeal.",

    "reference_summary": "Nottingham City Council, the appellant, is the licensing authority for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) in its area under Part 2 of the Housing Act 2004 (2004 Act).\nThis appeal concerns two HMOs, 44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue which are owned by the second respondent, Trevor Parr Associates Ltd. The first respondent, Dominic Parr, is the managing director of the second respondent and the manager of the two HMOs.\nThe 2004 Act requires HMOs to be licensed by the local housing authority.\nThe local housing authority can grant the application under section 64 of the 2004 Act if it is satisfied that, among other requirements, the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons [specified in the application or decided by the authority] or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of conditions under section 67 [of the 2004 Act].\nThe appellant issued guidance on the operation of the licensing system, which provides that the minimum space provision in the case of bedrooms in single occupation in HMOs is eight square metres, although a degree of flexibility is sometimes possible if other features are present. 44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue are both used for letting to students and each has an attic bedroom with an area of useable living space below eight square metres.\nIn each case, the appellant granted an HMO licence which imposed a condition prohibiting the use of the attic bedroom for sleeping.\nThe respondents appealed to the First tier Tribunal against the imposition of the conditions.\nThe First tier Tribunal at separate hearings deleted the conditions imposed by the appellant.\nIn the case of 44, Rothesay Avenue it substituted a condition that the attic bedroom may only be used for sleeping accommodation by a full time student who resides in the bedroom for a maximum of ten months in each year.\nThe appellant appealed both decisions to the Upper Tribunal, which dismissed the appeals and also directed that the substituted condition be included in the HMO licence for 50, Bute Avenue.\nThe appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the decision of the Upper Tribunal and included further conditions in both HMO licences that the communal space be kept available for communal living only and that no bedrooms be let to persons other than full time students.\nThe appellant appealed to the Supreme Court contending that the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 Act cannot be used to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable, and that the conditions imposed by the First tier Tribunal, Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal are irrational and unenforceable.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, subject to varying the conditions to delete the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year.\nLord Lloyd Jones gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices agree.\nSection 64(3)(a) of the 2004 Act indicates that the purpose of the imposition of conditions is to make a house reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons specified in the application or decided by the housing authority.\nSection 67(1)(a) provides that a licence may include such conditions as the local housing authority considers appropriate for regulating all or any of the management, use and occupation of the house concerned, and section 67(2) sets out a non exhaustive list of permitted conditions including conditions imposing restrictions or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it [18].\nThese words in their natural meaning are sufficiently wide to include the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal [18].\nSuch a reading is also consistent with the object and purpose of the 2004 Act.\nElsewhere in Part 2 of the 2004 Act, the manner of occupation and characteristics of occupants are considered relevant in contexts connected with HMOs and housing standards generally [20].\nThe guidance in respect of the 2004 Act also supports the view that the manner of occupation of a room and the type of occupant may have a bearing on the suitability of a particular room for a particular use [23].\nThe Court does not consider that the conditions in issue introduce an exception for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances [24].\nFurthermore, they do not permit occupation at a lower standard [25].\nIt is therefore appropriate to have regard to the proposed mode of occupation in considering the suitability of accommodation in an HMO [26].\nIn particular, account should be taken of the proposed mode of occupation where it is likely to influence the quality of the accommodation made available to the occupant.\nHowever, this does not permit the application of lower standards than would otherwise be applicable [26].\nThus, the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 Act can be used to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable [27].\nThe Court agrees with the Court of Appeal that the conditions imposed by the Tribunals were deficient in that they failed to require any part of the HMO to be available for communal living and did not require the bedrooms other than the attic bedrooms to be let to students.\nThat deficiency was, however, cured by the further conditions introduced by the Court of Appeal [33].\nThe condition limiting the occupation to persons engaged in full time education is rational [35] and enforceable [37].\nThe Court considers, however, that the requirement limiting occupation to ten months in each year is irrational [36].\nTherefore, subject to the deletion of the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year, the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal in each case, considered cumulatively, were entirely lawful.\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court varies the conditions to delete the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year but otherwise dismisses the appeal [38].",

    "reference_summary": "The benefit cap was introduced in the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and implemented by the Benefit Cap (Housing Benefit) Regulations 2012 (the Regulations).\nThe main issue in this appeal is whether the Regulations are unlawful under the Human Rights Act 1998.\nIt is argued that the cap has an unjustifiably discriminatory impact on women in relation to their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, contrary to article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights taken with article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR (A1P1).\nThe cap applies where the total entitlement of a single person or couple to specified welfare benefits exceeds an amount which represents the average weekly earnings of a working household in Great Britain, net of tax and national insurance contributions.\nThe Regulations fix the cap at 350 a week for a single claimant without dependent children, and 500 for all other claimants.\nBenefits taken into account include housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit.\nThe Governments justification for the scheme is that it is necessary (i) to set a reasonable limit on the extent to which the state will support non working families from public funds; (ii) provide members of households of working age with a greater incentive to work and (iii) achieve savings in public expenditure.\nThe cap does not apply to persons or families entitled to working tax credit.\nReceipt of this benefit requires a lone parent responsible for a child to work at least 16 hours a week, and a couple with a child to work a total of 24 hours a week, with one of them working at least 16 hours.\nThe cap affects a higher number of women than men.\nThat is because the majority of non working households receiving the highest levels of benefits are single parent households, and most single parents are women.\nThe appellants are two lone mothers and their youngest children.\nThe application of the cap reduced SGs weekly income from the specified benefits by 75, and NSs by 55.\nThe courts below held that the indirectly discriminatory impact of the scheme upon lone parents, and therefore women, could be justified and that the scheme was therefore lawful.\nThe Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by a majority of 3 2.\nLord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Hughes agrees.\nLord Carnwath concurs with the result but for different reasons.\nLady Hale and Lord Kerr each give dissenting judgments.\nLord Reed notes that it was conceded that the Regulations result, indirectly, in differential treatment of men and women in relation to welfare benefits, and that the benefits constitute possessions falling within A1P1. [60 61] The question is whether the cap is a proportionate means of meeting legitimate aims.\nLord Reed accepts that the aims of the cap are legitimate. [63 66] In relation to proportionality, the appellants argued that the aim of setting a reasonable limit to benefits could be achieved by setting the cap at the average income of working households inclusive of in work benefits, rather than their average earnings exclusive of benefits.\nLord Reed notes, however, that the Act requires the cap to be set by reference to earnings. [67 69] The appellants also argued that the savings in public expenditure were marginal.\nLord Reed notes that, although the short term savings are a small proportion of the total welfare budget, they nevertheless contribute towards deficit reduction.\nThe cap is also intended to change behaviour over the longer term.\nOther arguments focused on the impact of the cap on the families affected.\nLord Reed notes that the cap for households with children is equivalent to\na gross annual salary of 35,000, which is higher than the earnings of half of the UKs working households.\nWhether the cap should be higher is a political question.\nIt is not the function of the courts to determine how much public expenditure should be devoted to welfare benefits.\nImportantly, affected households were given advance notice and assistance to enable them to adjust. [70 75] The differential impact results from including child related benefits in the cap.\nExcluding these would reduce savings by 80 90% and compromise the achievement of the caps legitimate aims.\nNo credible means were suggested by which those aims might be achieved without affecting more women than men. [76 77] Other arguments relied on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which has not been incorporated by Parliament into UK law, but which can be relevant to the application of the ECHR.\nStrasbourg cases do not support the argument that the cap impinges on the article 8 ECHR rights of children, and that therefore article 3(1) UNCRC obliged the Government to treat the best interests of children as a primary consideration. [78 80] Although the UNCRC can be relevant to questions concerning the rights of children under the ECHR, the present context is one of alleged discrimination against women in the enjoyment of their A1P1 property rights. [86 89] The argument that the Regulations were vitiated by the Governments misinterpretation of article 3(1) was no stronger.\nIt is firmly established that UK courts cannot interpret or apply treaties to which Parliament has not given effect. [90] Lord Reed further reasons that the question of proportionality involves controversial issues of social and economic policy, with major implications for public spending.\nIt is therefore necessary for the court to give due weight to the considered assessment of democratically elected institutions.\nUnless manifestly without reasonable foundation, their assessment should be respected by the court.\nMany of the issues in the appeal were considered by Parliament before it approved the Regulations.\nThe Governments view, endorsed by Parliament, that achieving its aims was sufficiently important to justify making the Regulations, despite the differential impact on men and women, was not manifestly without reasonable foundation. [92 96] Lord Hughes adds that Strasbourgs case law is a long way from saying that article 3(1) is relevant to justification of any kind of discrimination, whether or not the rights, upbringing, or family life of a child are affected. [144] Lord Carnwath agrees that article 3(1) UNCRC has no role in justifying discrimination against women: the treatment of the child does not depend on the sex of their parent. [129] It is trite law that unincorporated treaties like the UNCRC have no direct effect in domestic law unless and until incorporated by statute. [115] On compliance with article 3(1), he reasons that the Governments reliance on limiting expenditure and the need for a clear upper limit on benefits ignores the distinctive statutory purpose of child related benefits: to meet the needs of children as individuals.\nThe cap means children lose these benefits for reasons unrelated to their own needs.\nIf excluding those benefits emasculates the scheme, this raises questions about the viability of a scheme so dependent on child related benefits.\nHowever, though the Secretary of State failed to show how the Regulations comply with article 3(1), it is in the political, rather than the legal, arena that the consequences should be played out. [123 127, 133] Lady Hale, in her dissenting judgment, reasons that the question is whether the legitimate aims of the cap justify the discrimination involved in its implementation. [189] The manifestly without reasonable foundation test applies to both the aims of the interference with property rights, and the proportionality of the discriminatory means employed. [209] The UNCRC has not yet been generally translated into domestic law, but Strasbourg case law shows that article 3(1) UNCRC is relevant to proportionality and discrimination as well as informing the substantive content of Convention rights, even in cases where the discrimination is not against the children but their mothers. [215 222] What has to be considered is whether the benefit cap as it applies to lone parents can be justified independently of its discriminatory effects.\nIn considering that, it is necessary to ask whether proper account has been taken of the best interests of the children affected, i.e. whether the Government complied with article 3(1).\nIt is clear to Lady Hale that it did not.\nThe cap deprives some children of provision for their basic needs, which cannot be in their best interests.\nIt does so in order to incentivise their parents to seek work, but discriminates against lone parents, who are least likely to be able to do so. [223 226] In light of article 3(1), the indirect sex discrimination inherent in the caps implementation is not a proportionate way of achieving its aims. [228] Lord Kerr, in his dissenting judgment, considers that the UNCRC can be directly enforceable in domestic law. [255 256] He further reasons that a mothers personality is defined not simply by her gender but by her role as carer for her children, so that justification of a discriminatory measure must directly address the impact on the children of lone mothers.

    "reference_summary": "In 2005, the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) obtained an interim receiving order over certain properties acquired by Mrs Szepietowskis husband with money allegedly obtained through drug trafficking, mortgage fraud and concealment from the Revenue.\nIn November 2006, the ARA began civil proceedings against Mr and Mrs Szepietowski (the Szepietowskis), seeking to confiscate 20 properties on the basis that they constituted recoverable property within section 266 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).\nThese properties included Ashford House (the Szepietowskis home), two properties known as Thames Street, two properties known as Church Street, and two properties known as Claygate.\nThese properties were all registered in the name of Mrs Szepietowski and had been charged to RBS for a debt of about 3.225m (the RBS debt).\nOn 16 January 2008, the Szepietowskis and the ARA settled the proceedings on terms contained in documents attached to a consent order (including a Settlement Deed).\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Deed, (a) Thames Street and Church Street were sold and the proceeds paid over in part satisfaction of the RBS debt, and (b) in September 2009, Mrs Szepietowski granted a charge over Claygate (the 2009 Charge) to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA, as the ARA had by this point become) entitling SOCA to recover a sum of up to 1.24m from the proceeds of sale of Claygate.\nThe 2009 Charge (a) was a second charge over Claygate as it was subject to the RBS debt, and (b) contained various provisions including a statement that Mrs Szepietowski had no personal liability to pay any money to SOCA.\nIn late 2009, Mrs Szepietowski sold Claygate for 2.44m and, once the net proceeds of sale of Claygate had been used to pay off the RBS debt, all that was left to satisfy SOCAs rights under the 2009 Charge was 1,324.16.\nSOCA then sought to invoke the right to marshal against Ashford House.\nThe right to marshal classically applies when there are two or more creditors, each of whom is owed a debt by the same debtor, but one of whom has security in the form of a charge on more than one property (the first mortgagee), whilst the other has security in the form of an inferior charge on only one of those properties (the second mortgagee).\nIf the first mortgagee chooses to enforce his charge against the property which secures both debts (the common property), the second mortgagee is able to enforce his charge against the property which only secured the first mortgagees debt (the other property).\nSOCA argued that, as the proceeds of sale of Claygate (the common property, which was subject to the charge in favour of RBS and the 2009 Charge in favour of SOCA) were used to pay off what was due to RBS, it was entitled under the marshalling principle to look to Ashford House (the other property, which was only subject to the charge in favour of RBS), in order to obtain payment of the sum which it would have obtained on the sale of Claygate if RBS had sold Ashford House and used the proceeds of sale to clear the RBS debt.\nMrs Szepietowski argued that SOCA should not be allowed to marshal because (a) the 2009 Charge did not secure a debt from her to SOCA and/or (b) the provisions of the Settlement Deed\nand the 2009 Charge, coupled with the circumstances in which they were executed, demonstrated that marshalling was precluded.\nHenderson J held that SOCAs marshalling claim was well founded ([2010] EWHC 2570 (Ch)) and the Court of Appeal agreed ([2011] EWCA Civ 856).\nThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal by Mrs Szepietowski.\nLord Neuberger, with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Reed agree, holds that the 2009 Charge did not create, or acknowledge the existence of, any debt from Mrs Szepietowski, or anyone else, to SOCA, save that under its terms, she was bound to pay SOCA an amount of up to 1.24m out of such sum if any, as remained from the proceeds of sale of Claygate after any prior claim had been met [40 43].\nAs a matter of principle, marshalling is not available to a second mortgagee where the common property does not secure a debt due from the mortgagor, but is merely available as security for whatever amount the second mortgagee can extract from that property.\nIn such a case, there is nothing from which the right to marshal against the other property can arise [46 50].\nNot least because marshalling is an equitable remedy, whether it is available in any particular case may depend on the circumstances.\nHowever, where there is no surviving debt due from the mortgagor to the second mortgagee after the sale and distribution of proceeds of sale of the common property, in the absence of express words which permit or envisage marshalling, it is hard to conceive how marshalling would be available [56 58].\nIf, contrary to this conclusion, marshalling is in principle available to a second mortgagee where there is no underlying debt, Mrs Szepietowskis appeal would still have been allowed.\nWhere facts arise which potentially give rise to the right to marshal, the correct approach is to ask whether, in the perception of an objective reasonable bystander at the date of the grant of the second mortgage, taking into account (i) the terms of the second mortgage, (ii) any contract or other arrangement which gave rise to it, (iii) what passed between the parties prior to its execution, and (iv) all the admissible surrounding facts, it is reasonable to conclude that the second mortgagee was nonetheless not intended to be able to marshal [60 62].\nThe statutory background to, and the terms of, the 2009 Charge and of the Settlement Deed, coupled with all the surrounding circumstances demonstrate that the parties did not intend SOCA to have the right to marshal [64 72].\nThe fact that Ashford House was Mrs Szepietowskis home is one of the relevant background facts for that purpose, but it was insufficient on its own to prevent a right to marshal if such a right otherwise existed.\nWhere the requirements of the right to marshal are otherwise present, it would require a contractually enforceable obligation, or something close thereto, on the first mortgagee to enforce against the common property in priority to the other property, for the second mortgagee to lose the right to marshal [73 77].\nLord Carnwath and Lord Hughes would allow the appeal on the narrower basis, namely that, read against the statutory background provided by the 2002 Act, and the fact that the 2009 Charge excluded any personal liability on the part of Mrs Szepietowski, that Charge impliedly excluded recourse to any source for payment other than those identified, and in particular excluded the right to marshal.",

2) Whether a defence provided by a pre existing contract (such as the charterparty) can be taken into account in determining whether a person if sued, might also have been held liable for the purposes of section 3(2); and 3) If the answer to (2) is yes, whether clause 33(5) of the charterparty has the effect that Asco is not a person who, if sued, might have also been held liable to Farstad for the purposes of section 3(2).\nThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.\nThe Court holds that Enviroco is not entitled to a contribution from Asco under section 3(2) of the 1940 Act because it cannot establish that if sued Asco might have been liable to Farstad in respect of losses caused by the fire.\nLord Clarke delivered the leading judgment.\nLord Clarke, with whom all other members of the Court agree, considered the first two questions together as both involve the construction of the 1940 Act.\nAlthough section 3(2) is specifically intended to deal with the position where there are two actions it is not limited to such a case and the claim for contribution could be made by third party proceedings in the same action (paras [11] [12]).\nThe words if sued are to be construed as meaning relevantly, competently and timeously sued (para [14]).\nThe question under section 3(2) is whether, if Asco had been sued by Farstad, it would have been liable.\nThat depends upon whether Asco would have had a defence to Farstads claim.\nThe outcome of the appeal therefore depends upon the true construction of the charterparty, with the essential question being whether clause 33.5 of the charterparty excludes Ascos liability to Farstad in respect of damage to the vessel caused by Ascos own negligence (paras [15] [16]).\nThe Court found that it does (paras [24], [29]).\nEnviroco is not entitled to contribution from Asco under section 3(2) of the 1940 Act because it cannot establish that if sued Asco might have been liable to Farstad in respect of losses caused by the fire (paras [15], [16], [19] [29]).\nThis conclusion makes the remaining question whether the position would be different if clause 33.5 were only an indemnity rather than an exclusion clause irrelevant.\nThe Court did not accept the argument that, if clause 33.5 was only an indemnity clause Farstad would have been entitled to a joint and several decree against both Asco and Enviroco and both would be found joint and severally liable in damages within the meaning of section 3(1) of the 1940 Act.\nThe charterparty is governed by English law and such a claim by Farstad would be met by the defence of circuity of action.\nIn other words, it would be useless in such circumstances to give judgment for Farstad against Asco as there could be no order of the court that Asco pay damages to Farstad.\nAlthough not called circuity of action, Scots law applies what is in effect the same principle.\nTherefore, even if it were a matter of Scots law, the answer would be the same and any action by Farstad against Asco would clearly fail (paras [30] [34], [44], [59]).\nIn his judgment, Lord Rodger confirmed that the Courts construction of section 3(2) is in line with the established case law of the courts of New Zealand and Canada on similar provisions.\nThe policy which underlies the decisions of those courts is equally applicable to Scots law.\nThe appeal is allowed and the decision of the Lord Ordinary is restored.",

    "reference_summary": "The Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) placed responsibility for the management of parades in Northern Ireland in the hands of an independent statutory body called the Parades Commission.\nThe Act placed a duty on anyone proposing to organise a public procession to give advance notice to the police and made it a criminal offence to organise, or take part in, a public procession of which notification had not been given.\nOn 3 December 2012 Belfast City Council decided to stop flying the Union flag over Belfast City Hall every day.\nThe flag was to be flown on certain designated days only.\nThe decision sparked a wave of protests by loyalists which continued for some months and became known as the flags protests.\nThe protesters marched from a meeting point in East Belfast to Belfast City Hall in the centre of the city and back again.\nThe route took the parade through the Short Strand, which is perceived to be a nationalist area, and where violence, disorder and sectarian abuse were directed at residents.\nNo notification was made under the 1998 Act that a parade was due to take place.\nInitially, in order to prevent potential disorder, the police had taken the decision not to permit the protesters to enter Belfast City Centre.\nBut between 6 and 8 December 2012 this decision was changed, as it was considered there was a need to try to facilitate some form of protest in order to ease community tension.\nTherefore, when the parades began on 8 December 2012 the protesters were permitted to enter the City Centre and pass through the Short Strand area.\nThe weekly parades continued until March 2013, during which time the police took no action to stop them.\nThe police made a number of public announcements to the effect that it had no power to stop a parade that had not been notified under the 1998 Act.\nThey also tried, unsuccessfully, to refer the matter to the Parades Commission.\nThe appellant, a resident of Short Strand, issued judicial review proceedings challenging the failure of the police to take action to prevent the parades from taking place.\nThe High Court found that the police had failed to appreciate the extent of its powers to stop an un notified parade, which had the effect of undermining the 1998 Act.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the Chief Constables appeal.\nDB appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously allows DBs appeal and declares that the Police Service of Northern Ireland misconstrued their legal powers to stop parades passing through or adjacent to the Short Strand area.\nLord Kerr gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\nThe flag protests presented the Police Service of Northern Ireland with enormous, almost impossible difficulties [1].\nThere can be no suggestion that they failed to treat them with sufficient seriousness.\nThis case is not about the sincerity and authenticity of those efforts, it is about whether, corporately, the police were sufficiently aware of the full range and scope of the powers available to them [3].\nThe police have a duty, under the general law, to prevent the commission of offences.\nParticipating in an un notified parade is a criminal offence under the 1998 Act and as such the police therefore had the power to prevent the parades.\nThe police failed properly to appreciate this, instead believing that they only had a power to prevent the commission of general public order offences [10].\nThe police were not required to form a judgment as to whether a parade should take place, but they were required to decide whether the parade was taking place legally.\nFailure to notify a proposed parade strikes at the heart of the effective functioning of the Parades Commission and therefore at the successful implementation of the 1998 Act.\nThis Act represented a paradigm shift away from the old system where police were drawn into the controversial role of deciding which parades should be permitted to take place and under what conditions they should be allowed to proceed [63].\nThe police failed to recognise that the integrity of the system depended on the enforcement of the requirement to notify an intention to hold a parade [64].\nIt is the police, not the Parades Commission, who have the responsibility for preventing un notified parades from taking place [45].\nThe police mistakenly believed that they were obliged by article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (freedom of assembly and association) to facilitate peaceful protests, even though they thought the protests were technically illegal.\nTo the contrary, they had an inescapable duty to prevent, where possible, what were plainly illegal parades from taking place and to protect those whose rights under article 8 of the European Convention (respect for private life) were in peril of being infringed, subject to operational constraints.\nIn general, a decision to disperse a parade or protest which has not been lawfully notified will not infringe article 11.\nThere was no warrant for allowing article 11 considerations to determine how the parades should be policed [60 62].\nThe High Court was therefore right to conclude that the police laboured under a misapprehension as to the extent of their powers [70].\nThe polices policy did not, however, have the intention or the effect of undermining the 1998 Act [66].\nThe police had an operational discretion in deciding how to respond to the parades.\nDiscussion of what action might have been taken had the police properly understood the limits of their powers is unlikely to was unhelpful [74].\nDifficulties in making policing decisions should not be underestimated, especially since these frequently require to be made in fraught circumstances [76].\nThe absence of a more proactive approach was not caused by police inertia, but by a concatenation of unfortunate circumstances, including misunderstandings about the powers available to them [77].",

    "reference_summary": "This case is about the application of EU food hygiene rules to certain chicken and pork products manufactured by the appellant, Newby Foods Ltd (Newby).\nSpecifically, the appeal concerns whether these products should be classified as mechanically separated meat (MSM) within point 1.14 of Annex I to EU Regulation No 853/2004 (the Regulation).\nNewby argues they should not be classified as MSM.\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) contends that they should be so classified.\nIt is now common for the butchering of animal carcases in the food industry across the EU to be carried out by machines.\nThese often leave a significant amount of meat on the bone.\nUnder the Regulation, there are two types of MSM: (1) high pressure MSM and (2) low pressure MSM.\nThe specific hygiene requirements for both are set by paragraphs 3 4, Chapter III, Section V, Annex III in the Regulation.\nFurther, MSM cannot count towards food meat content and attracts specific labelling requirements.\nMSM produced from lamb and beef bones is prohibited entirely under EU law.\nConsequently, the commercial value of MSM is much lower than that of other fresh meat products.\nNewby has developed a machine to remove residual meat from carcase bones.\nIt uses this to process residual meat on beef, lamb and pork bones after the initial boning of the animal carcases and on chicken carcases after the breasts have first been removed by other mechanical processes.\nThe Newby process has two stages: (1) meat bearing bones are forced into contact to remove meat by shearing and (2) meat so removed is then passed through a machine producing a product similar to minced meat.\nNewbys meat product was previously known in the UK as desinewed meat (DSM).\nIt was widely regarded as distinct from MSM, including by the FSA.\nDSM is not a category recognised in EU law.\nOn 4 April 2012, following criticism by the Commission, the FSA issued a moratorium with the result that DSM could (1) no longer be produced from residual meat on beef and lamb bones and (2) only be produced from residual meat on chicken and pork bones if classified and labelled as MSM.\nNewby brought judicial review proceedings challenging the moratorium.\nOn 16 July 2013, Edwards Stuart J in the High Court made a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the definition of MSM in point 1.14 of Annex I of the Regulation (point 1.14).\nThe CJEU made a preliminary ruling on 16 October 2014 (the CJEU judgment).\nAfter the CJEU judgment, Newby abandoned its challenge to the moratorium as to lamb and beef carcases, but not pork and chicken.\nOn 23 March 2016, Edwards Stuart J concluded that the pork and chicken meat products resulting from stage (1) of Newbys process are not MSM.\nHe also found that such DSM was not a product derived from bone scrapings.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the challenge to the moratorium, but upheld the judges finding as to bone scrapings.\nNewby now appeals to the Supreme Court on the proper interpretation of point 1.14 in light of the CJEU judgment.\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\nLord Sales gives the lead judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.\nThe proper interpretation of point 1.14 requires a correct application of the guidance provided in the CJEU judgment [51].\nIn its preliminary ruling, the CJEU identified three cumulative criteria in defining MSM for the purposes of point 1.14: (1) the use of bones from which the intact muscles have already been detached, or of poultry carcases, to which meat remains attached; (2) the use of methods of mechanical separation to recover that meat; and (3) the loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure of the meat recovered through the use of those processes [26].\nThe CJEU added that any meat product which satisfies those three criteria must be classified as MSM, irrespective of the degree of loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure, provided the loss or modification is greater than that which is strictly confined to the cutting point (the cutting point qualification) [26].\nIn the Supreme Court, it was common ground between the parties that Newbys pork and chicken products meet the first two criteria for categorisation of MSM within point 1.14 [52].\nThe appeal thus turns on whether Newbys products meet criterion (3), in light of the cutting point qualification [52].\nAs identified in the courts below, there are two main possible readings of what the CJEU meant by cutting point: (1) on a narrower reading, it refers to the cutting of intact muscles, or (2) on a more expansive reading, it refers to the points at which the meat has been severed or separated during the process of recovering it [39].\nEdwards Stuart J favoured the more expansive reading [42 43], while the Court of Appeal preferred the narrower reading [45 46].\nThis Court finds that, on the proper interpretation of the CJEU judgment, the narrower reading is correct [51].\nFirst, the way in which the CJEU formulated criterion (1) reflects the words removing meat from flesh bearing bones after boning or from poultry carcases in point 1.14 [54].\nThe CJEUs formulation speaks of meat remaining attached to poultry carcases, rather than simply referring to poultry carcases, which would include all (not merely some of) the meat on the carcase [55].\nSecondly, the CJEU clearly held that the concept of MSM does not depend on it being shown that the process referred to in point 1.14 results in a loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure which is significant, rejecting outright Newbys case [56].\nOn the CJEUs approach, the dividing line is much clearer.\nMeat removed from a carcase will not be MSM if it is removed by mechanical means in the first phase of cutting meat from the whole carcase, but will generally be MSM if it is later removed by mechanical means [57].\nThis clear distinction avoids the need for microscopic investigation [57].\nThirdly, the legal analysis is not affected by evidence (1) that chicken carcases will occasionally be subjected to Newbys process without the breasts first being removed or (2) that the wishbone is usually cut out of the breast meat before mechanical removal of whole chicken breasts [61 63].\nLastly and importantly, the CJEU judgment made it explicit that, applying the definition in point 1.14, Newbys products fall to be categorised as MSM [66].\nThe CJEU was entitled to express its view on the application of point 1.14 to this case and there is nothing to call into question its analysis [69 75].\nAfter the CJEU judgment, the position is acte clair and no further reference to the CJEU is needed [76].\nThe Court reaches the above conclusions having seen, but not relied on, further evidence submitted by three of the four interveners [49 50].\nThe Court refuses permission to admit this further evidence due to unfairness to the FSA and, in any event, this evidence is not considered to affect the outcome [50].",
    "predicted_summary": "to the opinion of Advocate General Kokott in Case C 453/13 Newby Foods Ltd v Food Standards Agency [2015] QB 1035, paras 34 35, where she said: It is true that the wording of point 1.14 of Annex I to the Regulation is broad enough to cover all methods of mechanical separation of meat from bones.\nBut it is equally true that the wording of point 1.14 is not so broad that it covers every method of mechanical processing of meat whatsoever.\nIf that were the case, then the distinction between MSM and minced meat would lose all significance.\nThe wording of point 1.14 must therefore be read in conjunction with the wording of point 1.13.\nPoint 1.13 defines minced meat as boned meat that has been minced into fragments and contains less than 1% salt.\nIt is clear that minced meat is a product that has been subjected to a mechanical process.\nBut it is equally clear that the mechanical process in question is not one that involves the separation of meat from bones.\nRather, it is a process that involves the fragmentation of meat that has already been separated from bones.\nThe judge noted that the Advocate Generals opinion was that the word mechanical in point 1.14 should be understood as meaning mechanical in the sense of involving the separation of meat from bones, rather than mechanical in the sense of involving any mechanical process whatever.\nHe observed that the FSA accepted that the Advocate Generals approach was correct, but maintained that the word mechanical in point 1.14 should be understood as meaning mechanical in the latter sense.\nThe judge considered that the FSA had failed to address the point raised by the Advocate General that, if the word mechanical in point 1.14 were to be understood as meaning mechanical in the latter sense, then the distinction between MSM and minced meat would lose all significance.\nHe concluded that the Advocate Generals approach was the most plausible reading of the words of point 1.14, and that the FSA had failed to provide any convincing explanation why the word mechanical should be understood as meaning mechanical in the former sense.\nHe also noted that the FSA had failed to address the point raised by Newby that, even if the word mechanical in point 1.14 were to be understood as meaning mechanical in the former sense, the residual meat removed by the Newby process was not significantly modified by the mechanical process in question.\nThe judge concluded that the FSA had failed to address the points raised by the Advocate General and Newby, and that it had failed to provide any convincing explanation why the residual meat removed by the Newby process should be classified as MSM.\nHe stated that, in the light of these failures, he was inclined to think that the Advocate Generals approach was correct, and that the residual meat removed by the Newby process was not MSM.\nHe also stated that, in any event, he thought that the residual meat removed by the Newby process was not significantly modified by the mechanical process in question, and that it was therefore not MSM.\nThe judge concluded that the FSA had failed to establish that the residual meat removed by the Newby process was MSM, and that the moratorium was unlawful.\nThe CJEU judgment\nThe CJEU judgment was delivered by the Tenth Chamber of the Court.\nThe judgment begins by summarising the facts and the questions referred to the Court.\nAt para 11, the Court notes that the FSA accepts that the Newby process is not identical to the process of high pressure MSM, but submits that the difference is irrelevant because the Newby process still involves a mechanical separation of meat from bones.\nThe Court observes that the FSA relies on the wording of point 1.14 of Annex I to the Regulation, according to which MSM is defined as the product obtained by removing meat from flesh bearing bones after boning or from poultry carcases, using mechanical means resulting in the loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure.\nThe Court notes that the FSA argues that the expression mechanical means in point 1.14 should be understood as meaning mechanical in general, and that the expression loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure should be understood as meaning any alteration of the muscle fibre structure.\nThe Court observes that Newby, on the other hand, submits that the expression mechanical means in point 1.14 should be understood as meaning mechanical in the sense of involving the separation of meat from bones, and that the expression loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure should be understood as meaning significant alteration of the muscle fibre structure.\nThe Court notes that the Advocate General has proposed an intermediate solution, according to which the expression mechanical means in point 1.14 should be understood as meaning mechanical in the sense of involving the separation of meat from bones, but that the expression loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure should be understood as meaning any alteration of the muscle fibre structure.\nThe Court observes that the FSA accepts that the Advocate Generals proposal is a possible interpretation of the wording of point 1.14, but submits",
